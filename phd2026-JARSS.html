<h2>PhD scholarships at the University of Strathclyde 2026</h2>


<p>The Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the
University of Strathclyde is welcoming applications for PhD
studentships. We are expecting that there will be full funding for several UK home students as part of
the <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/studywithus/scholarships/johnandersonresearchstudentshipschemejarss/">John
Anderson Research Studentship Scheme</a> (JARSS). The studentship
covers tuition fees, a stipend for living expenses, and a small travel
budget.</p>

<p><strong>The studentship package is predominately aimed for those classed as UK Home Students.
    For International students, other sources of funding are more than likely to be required to cover the cost of tuition.</strong></p>

<p>Applicants in the area of the Mathematically Structured Programming
(MSP) Group are strongly encouraged to apply. Within MSP, we see the
mathematical foundations of computation and programming as
inextricably linked, and study one so as to develop the other. This
reflects the symbiotic relationship between mathematics, logic, and
programming &mdash; any attempt to sever this connection will diminish each
  component.</p>
<p>
MSP Strathclyde is a fun and exciting place in the UK to do
fundamental research, and we all work together to make it a welcoming
environment.
</p>

<h3>Important Dates</h3>

<p>If you are interested in applying to join MSP as a JARSS Student,
  we ask that you contact a potential supervisor <em>as soon as possible</em>, by <strong>22 December, 2025</strong> at the latest.</p>
  <p>
  To help us ensure that you are a suitable candidate please send us a copy of your CV, together with an outline of your research interests.
</p>
<p>We will make a decision over your candidacy in the New Year, by <strong>Wednesday 7th January, 2026</strong>, and then look to put you forward for the scholarship.
