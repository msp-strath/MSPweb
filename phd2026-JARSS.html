<h2>PhD scholarships at the University of Strathclyde 2026</h2>


<p>The Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the
University of Strathclyde is welcoming applications for PhD
studentships. At least four fully funded positions are available for
UK home students as part of
the <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/studywithus/scholarships/johnandersonresearchstudentshipschemejarss/">John
Anderson Research Student Ship Scheme</a> (JARSS). The studentship
covers tuition fees, a stipend for living expenses, and a small travel
budget.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately, the funding provided is not enough
for non-UK tuition fees.</strong></p>

<p>Applicants in the area of the Mathematically Structured Programming
(MSP) Group are strongly encouraged to apply. Within MSP, we see the
mathematical foundations of computation and programming as
inextricably linked, and study one so as to develop the other. This
reflects the symbiotic relationship between mathematics, logic, and
programming &mdash; any attempt to sever this connection will diminish each
component.</p>

<p>If you are interested in applying, please contact a potential
supervisor as soon as possible, and <strong>before 26th November 2025</strong>.
Potential supervisors in the group are:</p>
