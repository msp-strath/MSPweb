<h2>Research Themes</h2>

<p>
  Our vision is to use <strong>mathematics to understand the nature of
  computation</strong>, and to turn that understanding into
  the <strong>next generation of programming languages</strong>.

<p>
  We see the mathematical foundations of computation and programming as
  inextricably linked. We study one so as to develop the other.

<p>
  This reflects the symbiotic relationship between mathematics,
  programming, and the design of programming languages &mdash; any attempt to
  sever this connection will diminish each component.

<p>
  To achieve these research goals we use ideas from the following
  disciplines:

<dl>
  <dt>Functional Programming</dt>
  <dd>
    What does the future of programming languages look like?
    Functional programming languages
    like <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda
    2</a> and Epigram are currently at the apex of programming
    language design and so form our target model of computation.
  </dd>

  <dt>Logic</dt>
  <dd>
    Why is functional programming successful as a model of
    computation? The answer lies in its genesis as a clean
    implementation of the logical structure of computation. Thus we
    develop functional programming by studying the logical structure
    of computation.
  </dd>

  <dt>Type Theory</dt>
  <dd>
    How does one take the logical structure of computation and turn it
    into a programming abstraction? Type theory allows us to do this
    by providing a language at an intermediate level of abstraction
    between a programming language and its logical
    foundations. Indeed, type theory could be said to be the ideas
    factory for programming languages.
  </dd>

  <dt>Category Theory</dt>
  <dd>
    How does one understand structure abstractly?  One uses category
    theoryâ€”that's how! Ideas such as monads and initial algebra
    semantics attest to the deep contribution that category theory has
    made to computation.
