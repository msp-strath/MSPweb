Meanwhile, modal logicians study the μ-calculus using very "1930s" concepts like explicitly named variables. Most of my efforts during my PhD have been spent trying to pull the theory of the modal μ-calculus into this century (AKA into Agda) using the tools of type theory, but my real interest is in what we type theorists might glean from the exchange. For example, the modal μ-calculus is a fixpoint logic, with a very mature account of fixpoint alternation - something that every proof assistant (to my knowledge) is lacking.<br>
In this talk, I'll be using the μ-calculus and some of my recent work on it as a motivating example to give a slightly non-standard introduction to some important MSP ideas - syntaxes with binding, and data types as fixpoints. I'll cover the least fixpoint (which computer scientists love), the greatest fixpoint (which we sometimes tolerate), and the rational fixpoint (which many forget exists, but plays a key role in my work). If time permits, I'd also like to open the door to the terrifying world of arbitrary fixpoint alternation, and some (very very early) ideas for taming it.</details><p><small>See the <a href="msp101.html">MSP101 seminar page</a> for a full list of future and past talks.</small></p></div>

<h2>Research Themes</h2>

<p>
  Our vision is to use <strong>mathematics to understand the nature of
  computation</strong>, and to turn that understanding into
  the <strong>next generation of programming languages</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  We see the mathematical foundations of computation and programming as
  inextricably linked. We study one so as to develop the other.
  This reflects the symbiotic relationship between mathematics,
  programming, and the design of programming languages &mdash; any attempt to
  sever this connection will diminish each component.
</p>

<p>
  To achieve these research goals we use ideas from the following
  disciplines:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Functional Programming and Type Theory</dt>
  <dd>
    What does the future of programming languages look like?  How does
    one take the logical structure of computation and turn it into a
    programming abstraction? Type theory allows us to do this by
    providing a language at an intermediate level of abstraction
    between a programming language and its logical
    foundations. Indeed, type theory could be said to be the ideas
    factory for programming languages.
  </dd>

  <dt>Logic</dt>
  <dd>
    Different logics are suitable for expressing and verifying
    different properties of programming languages or systems. We make
    use of a range of methods such as proof theory and coalgebra to
    understand the computational nature of proofs and systems intended
    to run without interruption. Those methods are driven by emerging
    problems in areas such as AI and security. We have particular
    strengths in modal logic, quantitative properties of systems, and
    logics for reasoning about concurrency.
  </dd>

  <dt>Category Theory</dt>
  <dd>
    How does one understand structure abstractly?  How can one build
    theories that systematically build complex systems by composing
    descriptions of simpler ones? One uses category theory &mdash;
    that's how!  Ideas such as monads and initial algebra semantics
    attest to the deep contribution that category theory has made to
    computation.
