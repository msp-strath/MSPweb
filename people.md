[Department of Computer and Information Sciences](http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk)
at the University of Strathclyde and comprises

[Prof. Neil Ghani](http://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/ghanineilprof/)

    containers, induction recursion, parametricity and all areas of
    category theory. See
    [Neil's current homepage](http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~ng/)
    for more details or email [neil.ghani [at]
