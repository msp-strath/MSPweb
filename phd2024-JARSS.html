<h2>PhD scholarships at the University of Strathclyde 2025</h2>

<p>The Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University
of Strathclyde is welcoming applications for PhD studentships. At least
four fully funded positions are available for UK home students, and
funding covers tuition fees, a stipend for living expenses, and a
small travel budget. <strong>Unfortunately, the funding provided is not enough
for non-UK tuition fees.</strong></p>

<p>Applicants in the area of the Mathematically Structured Programming
(MSP) Group are strongly encouraged to apply. Within MSP, we see the
mathematical foundations of computation and programming as
inextricably linked, and study one so as to develop the other. This
reflects the symbiotic relationship between mathematics, logic, and
programming &mdash; any attempt to sever this connection will diminish each
component.</p>

<p>If you are interested in applying, please contact a potential
supervisor as soon as possible, and before 25th November 2024.
Potential supervisors in the group are:</p>
