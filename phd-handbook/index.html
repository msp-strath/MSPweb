                <h2>MSP PhD Handbook</h2>

<p>
  A collection of useful information about everything PhD at MSP (and a bit
  more). For more general MSP information, see
  also <a href="https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/links.html">this list of useful
  links</a>.
</p>

<h3>University PhD Resources</h3>
<ul>
  <li>the <strong>Code of Practice for Postgraduate Research Students</strong> can
  be
    found <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/professionalservices/media/ps/cs/gmap/academicaffairs/policies/Policy_and_Code_of_Practice_for_Postgraduate_Research_Study.pdf">here
  [pdf]</a></li>

</ul>


<h3>Departmental Facilities</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The stationary cupboard</strong> provides you with all the
  staionary you may need for your research. It's located inside the departmental
  office on the 11th floor, and you can just go in.</li>
  <li><strong>Printing and Copying</strong> on the departmental printers, all
  the information is <a href="https://docs.cis.strath.ac.uk/labs/#printing-and-scanning">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Red Cards</strong> for out-of-hours access to Livingstone Tower: apply
  on <a href="https://local.cis.strath.ac.uk/wp/utilities/">local.cis</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Spider Credits</h3>
<p>
  Spider Credits are the faculty's system to record your "personal development"
  during the time of your PhD degree. To be able to graduate, you will have to
  record 60 credits, organised into 5 categories, and write a summative essay
  for each category at the end.
</p>

<p>
  The table with the your credit progress is on
  the <a href="https://spider.science.strath.ac.uk/">Spider</a> system, under:
  myStuff &rarr;
  <a href="https://spider.science.strath.ac.uk/spider/spider/modules/PG_DB/">postgraduate
  records</a> &rarr; PG Credits.
</p>

<p>
  For recording credits, you can use activities that you do during your PhD anyway
  (like attending a conference, or giving a talk), or attend
  courses which you have to book through the
  University's <a href="https://bookings.strath.ac.uk/">system</a>.  The
  official list of all possible activities that count towards credits
  is <a href="https://spider.science.strath.ac.uk/spider/spider/modules/PG_DB/student_credits_options.php?view=view">here</a>. The
  list below may be more useful though!
</p>

<p>
  You can add activities to the current academic year. In the end, it doesn't
  matter in which year you claim your credits (or whether the activity actually
  happened in the year you claim it). You can also already claim credits which
  you have not done yet, which might help with planning.
</p>

<p>
  For each activity you claim you have to submit a document with "evidence" of
  the activity. Don't outdo yourself here, it can just be something like a
  screenshot of a registration email for a workshop, or a document with a link
  to a personal blog etc.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some suggestions on which activities to use for the 5 columns:
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>RD901 "Researcher Knowledge and Intellectual Abilities" &mdash;
	20 credits</strong><br>
      This column requires double the amount of credits than any other one, but
      it should be fairly easy to fill with:
      <ul>
	<li>off-campus external training course (any spring or summer
	school)</li>
	<li>reading research papers</li>
	<li>conference attendance</li>
	<li>workshop attendance</li>
	<li>internship with external partner (there's a lot of credits in
	  here!)</li>
	<li>research group meeting attendance (use MSP101, MSP201)</li>
	<li>English language classes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li> <strong>RD902 "Researcher Personal Effectiveness" &mdash; 10
	credits</strong><br>
      Probably the hardest one to fill with activities you do anyway, so you may
	have to do some courses:
      <ul>
	<li>achievement of an award of prize</li>
	<li>conference volunteer</li>
	<li>elected member of an external organisation (maybe your hobby comes
	  in handy here?)</li>
	<li>organising a conference (e.g. SPLS)</li>
	<li>course "Postgraduate Research Student Induction" (this one you
	  probably do anyway)</li>
	<li>course "Engaging Beyond Academia: Industry, Networking and
	  Opportunity" (on MyPlace, so you can do it in your own time, and gives
	  quite a lot of credits)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li> <strong>RD903 "Research Governance and Organisation" &mdash; 10
	credits</strong><br>#
      Not the easiest one to fill, so you may have to do some courses:
      <ul>
	<li>obtaining external/departmental/faculty/etc. travel and training
	  funds (if you've ever applied for funding for going to a conference),
	  you can use this one quite often</li>
	<li>chairing a session at a conference</li>
	<li>sitting on a departmental/faculty/university committee (as PGR
	  rep)</li>
	<li>course "PG Essentials: Digital Scholarship Skills" (on MyPlace,
	  quite a lot of credits)</li>
	<li>course "Research Integrity (Online)" (on MyPlace)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li> <strong>RD904 "Researcher Engagement, Influence and Impact" &mdash; 10
	credits</strong><br>
      Should be very easy to fill with:
      <ul>
	<li>oral presentation at peer-reviewed international conference (10
	  credits!!)</li>
	<li>oral presentation at local/national conference (e.g. SPLS)</li>
	<li>poster presentation</li>
	<li>research group meeting presentation (MSP101!)</li>
	<li>make a significant contribution to the preparation of a peer
	  reviewed publication</li>
	<li>teaching/demonstrating/tutoring (~5 credits per course and term, up
	  to 3 times)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li> <strong>RD905 "Researcher Professional Development Elective" &mdash; 10
	credits</strong><br>
      You can use anything that counts towards any other column here. (So
      probably things from RD901 or RD904...)
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  There is a few very loosely specified activities, which may be useful if you
  can argue well enough that you've achieved them:
  <ul>
    <li>independent development of your ability to work with others, cognitive
      abilities, communication, creativity, engagement and impact, knowledge
      base, personal qualities, etc.</li>
    <li>recognised prior learning</li>
  </ul>
