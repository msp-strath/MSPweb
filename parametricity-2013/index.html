                <h2>Parametricity Workshop</h2>

<p>
  <strong>22nd May 2013</strong>.<br>
  <strong>Department of Computer and Information Sciences</strong>.<br>

<p>
  The idea of the workshop is to get people actively working on
  parametricity or logical relations together to discuss the latest
  research, and new research directions, in this area.

<p>
  The workshop is organised
  by <a href="https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/patricia.johann/">Patricia
  Johann</a>.<br> Email: <code>patricia.johann *at* strath.ac.uk</code>.
</p>

<p>
  This workshop is supported by
  the <a href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/">Scottish Informatics and
  Computer Science Alliance</a>.

      <td><p>Parametricity is a fundamental concept within programming 
languages designed to capture the idea that programs map related inputs to 
related outputs. Originally formulated by John Reynolds in the 1970s, 
parametrictiy has been a key tool in reasoning about programming languages 
ever since. However, as programming languages have advanced, parametricity 
has struggled to keep up. I think that part of the reason for this is that 
its not really clear what parametricity really is. We have lots of 
specific constructions of what a parametric model is but no satisfying 
overarching theory which can then be instantiated to a variety of 
different settings (operations, game-theoretic, constructive, domain 
theoretic etc)</p>
      <p>In this talk I'll explain some work we have been doing in Strathclyde 
recently whose goal is to suggest that while the usual semantics of 
programming languages can be given abstractly in terms of a categorical 
universe using concepts such as categories, functors and natural 
transformations, parametricity amounts to working in a fibrational 
universe consisting of fibred categories, fibred functors and fibred 
natural transformations.</p></td>

      <td align="left">Dependent type-theory is on the verge of becoming the standard 
way to formalize mathematics at the same time as displacing traditional 
platforms for high-insurance programming. However, current implementations 
of type theory are still lacking, in the sense that some obvious truths 
require explicit proofs, making type-theory awkward to use for many 
applications, both in formalization and programming. In particular, 
notions of erasure are poorly supported. We will present an extension of 
type-theory with colored terms, color erasure and interpretation of 
colored types as predicates. The result is a more powerful type-theory: 
some definitions and proofs may be omitted as they become trivial, it 
becomes easier to program with precise types, and some parametricity 
results can be internalized.</td>

<h3>Venue, Travel and Accommodation</h3>

<p>
  The workshop will take place
  in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=Livingstone+Tower,+Glasgow,+United+Kingdom&amp;hl=en&amp;ftid=0x488846a731346ff5:0x947b60e0f92c83d8"><strong>Livingstone
  Tower</strong></a>, which is part of the University of
  Strathclyde. Livingstone Tower is in central Glasgow, near to
  Glasgow Queen Street station. Below are travel instructions from
  Queen Street station, and from Glasgow and Edinburgh
  airports. Edinburgh and Glasgow airports are both served by several
  international airlines, and flights are available to and from major
  international hubs.

<h4>Accomodation</h4>

<p>
  A convenient place to stay was
  the <a href="http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/GLACIT/glasgow-city-centre-george-square">Glasgow
  City Centre Premier Inn</a>, just across the road from Strathclyde
  University.

<h4>From Glasgow Queen Street Station</h4>

<p>
  Livingstone Tower is a few minutes walk from Queen Street Station in
  the centre of Glasgow. The map above shows the general area.

<p>
  There is also
  an <a href="http://www.strath.ac.uk/maps/livingstonetower/">official
  university map</a>.

<h4>From Glasgow Airport</h4>

<p>
  For people arriving
  at <a href="http://www.glasgowairport.com/">Glasgow
  Airport</a>, <a href="http://www.glasgowairport.com/transport-and-directions/travel-into-glasgow-city-centre">here
  are instructions on how to get into the city centre</a>. Probably
  the easiest route is to
  take <a href="http://www.glasgowairport.com/transport-and-directions/buses-and-coaches">the
  airport bus</a> (Service 500) to Buchanan Street Bus station, which
  is close to Queen Street Station, and then to walk or take a taxi
  from there. The airport bus costs Â£7.50 for an open return.</p>

</ul>

<h4>From Edinburgh Airport</h4>

<p>
  For people arriving
  via <a href="http://www.edinburghairport.com/">Edinburgh
  Airport</a>, the best route is to take
  the <a href="http://www.flybybus.com/">airport bus</a> to Waverley
  Station in central Edinburgh and then take the train
  to <a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/807.aspx">Glasgow
  Queen Street</a>. There are trains every 15 minutes during the day,
  and every half an hour after 18.30. Note that train travel before
  9.30 and between 16.30 and 18.30 is peak time, and is more
  expensive.
