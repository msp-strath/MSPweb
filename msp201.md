MSP201 Study Group
------------

MSP201 is a series of study groups, aimed at PhD students and other academics interested in MSP topics.
We typically choose a book on a topic that we want to learn, and read it together over the course of several months.
Each week, one person is assigned a section of the book to read in advance, and presents it to the group.
We aim to keep a rather informal atmosphere where questions and digressions from the audience are welcome.
The study group usually happens in person, but we might occasionally set up a Zoom link upon request.

**How to join?** The study group is coordinated on [SPLS Zulipchat](https://spls.zulipchat.com), in the [#UoS stream](https://spls.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/227686-UoS/topic/MSP.20201.20study.20group).
Everyone is welcome to join and inquire about the current location and time of the 201, as well as vote on the choice of topic for the next edition!
