<h2>PhD Position: A Correct-by-Construction Approach to Approximate Computation</h2>

<p><strong>This position is no longer available.</strong></p>

<p>Applications are invited for a fully funded UK PhD studentship in the
areas of type theory, category theory and/or logic, under the
supervision of <a href="https://fredriknf.com">Dr Fredrik Nordvall Forsberg</a>, and Professors <a href="https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/neil.ghani/">Neil Ghani</a>
and <a href="https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/r.mardare/">Radu Mardare</a>. The research will be part of the recently
EPSRC-funded project <a href="https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/Y000455/1">"A Correct-by-Construction Approach to
Approximate Computation"</a>, which seeks to develop type-theoretic tools
and frameworks for approximation.</p>

<p>The position is for 3 years, with a start date of 1 October
2024. It includes both coverage of fees and an stipend, and is open to
UK-based applicants. <b>Note that unfortunately tuition fees for
international students are not covered by the position.</b></p>

<p>The successful applicant will become part of the Mathematically
Structured Programming group at the University of Strathclyde. It is
likely that you will also work with the other members in the group,
which include Conor McBride, Robert Atkey, Clemens Kupke, Glynn
Winskel, Jules Hedges, Guillaume Allais, Jan de Muijnck-Hughes, Ross
Horne, William Waites, and currently 10 PhD students. We are located
in the city centre of Glasgow, with plenty of both culture and nature
nearby. Scotland is a great place for theoretical computer science: we
have active collaborations with researchers Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt,
Glasgow and St. Andrews.</p>

<p>Applications, requests for further information, and other informal
enquiries can be sent
to <a href="mailto:fredrik.nordvall-forsberg@strath.ac.uk">Fredrik
Nordvall Forsberg</a>. If you are interested, please get in touch as
soon as you can. We hope to appoint in early March.</p>
