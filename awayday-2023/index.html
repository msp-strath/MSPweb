<h3>Programme</h3>

<p>Here is a <a href="MSP_AwayDays2023-schedule.pdf">PDF version of the schedule</a>.</p>

<p>The programme consists of talks, group discussion sessions, and unstructured time for research and/or physical activity. The discussion sessions will have the following themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>MSP Msc:</strong> Can we, and do we want to, create an MSc programme in Mathematically Structured Programming (or "Advanced Functional Programming", or similar)? What would we need to do to make it happen?</li>
  <li><strong>Group efforts:</strong> What do we want to do together? Or there research projects and grant applications where it would be benefical to pull from different strands of MSP? Outside of MSP, what can we do with the other research groups in the department, the university TIC clusters, etc, and even further afield?</li>
  <li><strong>Website:</strong> How can we make our website better? Are there good example of other group websites we can copy?</li>
  <li><strong>Teaching:</strong> MSP is not only a research group, but also a teaching group. How do we want to direct our efforts here?</li>
  <li><strong>PhD question time:</strong> A chance to ask (anonymous, if you wish) questions about anything you are wondering about.</li>
  <li><strong>Research environment:</strong> What works well, currently, and how can we make our research environment even better? For example, seminars, reading groups, the culture in LT1310, etc.</li>
</ul>
