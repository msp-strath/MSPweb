<h3>Programme</h3>

<p>Here is a <a href="MSP_AwayDays2023-schedule.pdf">PDF version of the schedule</a>.</p>

<p>The programme consists of talks, group discussion sessions, and unstructured time for research and/or physical activity. The discussion sessions will have the following themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>MSP Msc:</strong> Can we, and do we want to, create an MSc programme in Mathematically Structured Programming (or "Advanced Functional Programming", or similar)? What would we need to do to make it happen?</li>
  <li><strong>Group efforts:</strong> What do we want to do together? Or there research projects and grant applications where it would be benefical to pull from different strands of MSP? Outside of MSP, what can we do with the other research groups in the department, the university TIC clusters, etc, and even further afield?</li>
  <li><strong>Website:</strong> How can we make our website better? Keywords/questions to think about:
  <ul>
    <li>Are there good example of other group websites?</li>
    <li>Making the website responsive/mobile friendly?</li>
    <li>"Fun" projects, rather than grants</li>
    <li>Group photo, and photos of people</li>
    <li>Teaching?</li>
    <li>Rewrite generator in Agda?</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Teaching:</strong> MSP is not only a research group, but also a teaching group. How do we want to direct our efforts here?</li>
  <li><strong>PhD question time:</strong> A chance to ask (anonymous, if you wish) questions about anything you are wondering about.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://strath.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eVtQzq9STj1eynI">Survey for anonymous questions</a> (same as for research environment)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Research environment:</strong> What works well, currently, and how can we make our research environment even better? For example, seminars, reading groups, the culture in LT1310, etc.

<h3>Walking Suggestions</h3>
If you need some inspiration for what to do in the "unstructured" time, here are some suggestions for walks:
<ul>
  <li> a <a href="https://www.komoot.com/tour/1068501604/embed?share_token=aKH79fwW5ZYgP16EAmSh5ugsaHgMxx2o2ePl0b8OhPdGF3hXK8">medium length walk</a> from the hotel, including some great views, and the famous windy road!</li>
  <li> a slightly <a href="https://www.komoot.com/tour/1068506473/embed?share_token=aJHiVrtG4OvcsiWq6OJ6RXGxEoMIgalz5kH0Qv4xswvoNFjTl7">longer walk</a> from the hotel, looping around Rothesay</li>
  <li> a very nice <a href="https://www.komoot.com/tour/1084578808/embed?share_token=aTPKi4g0qHlT8okh2pm0BHnOV1AWmpy6A7b0yrNmh4DKqYatPx">coastal path</a> to a lighthouse and a litte beach. The start is in Kilchattan Bay, which is reachable by bus from the hotel.</br>
    Suggestion: bus 490 from "Rothesay, Mountstuart Road, opp Leopold Road" (opposite from the hotel) at 15:52.</br>
    Return with bus 490 from Kilchattan Bay at 18:15 (don't be late! The next bus is at 22:30). </br>
    This should leave enough time for the walk to the lighthouse and the beach, without rushing.
  </li> 
</ul>
