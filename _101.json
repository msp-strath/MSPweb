    "title": "Systems that model their environments, and systems that plan.",
    "abstract": " Consider a system interacting with its environment, perhaps in pursuit of some goal. We might want to ask whether the system has a model of its environment, especially in POMDP-like cases where the environment is partially observable and the system must make inferences about the environment's state in order to pursue its goal.\n\n But where does the model live in relation to the system? A simple answer is that the system's state parametrises a probability distribtion over environment states. This distribution isn't part of the system but is imposed upon it by an external observer. I will talk about how to model this observer-dependence via notion of 'interpretation' of a sytem, in which a system's internal states are interpreted as being 'about' a hidden environment state and as being updated using Bayes' theorem. A given system may have many interpretations, so that interpretations form a fibration over systems.\n\n A more interesting case is where a system uses a model not just to keep track of its environment but to reason about how to influence it. This is a lot harder to model, and I will talk about various pieces of work in progress towards understanding the relationships between systems, models and goals, with an emphasis on a category-theoretic perspective.",

    "title": "From discounted value to discounted state",
    "abstract": "The discounted value is a concept in Reinforcement Learning methods such as Value Iteration that allows to aggregate expected future rewards. It can be formalized as lens precomposition with a value function (which is a counit). We give some progress towards another class of RL methods that are based on parametrized policies, where this composition happens without the need of a counit, leading to a \"discounted state\" of a dynamical system. This has some resemblance to a List algebra, taken over a bicategory of linear relations of a vector space instead of over Set. The discounted state is used in the literature to prove the Policy Gradient Theorem, which we interpret as an Euler integration for noncommutative operators.",

    "title": "String Diagrams for Actegories",
    "abstract": "Actions of monoidal categories are structures useful for modelling interacting systems. They are central to the definition of optics, but have also found use elsewhere, for example in the semantics of message-passing. When working in categorical cybernetics we often depict monoidal actions using string diagrams with multiple categories juxtaposed, but this steps away from the formally specified semantics of string diagrams for monoidal categories which have coherence and completeness results making their manipulation valid for proving equalities. I will discuss how diagrams for actegories can be modelled more formally by considering them as certain bicategories using the construction of the collage of a bimodule.\n\n By depicting actegories as bicategories we obtain satisfying visual representations for actegory structures. We will see that the lax compositional structure of the collage gives rise to useful visualisations for the emergent behaviour between categories interacting via the action of a common monoidal category. This gets represented as coloured string diagrams glued together along certain shared boundaries. As a special case we can depict optics as diagrams with several regions which neatly frame the “forward”, “backward”, and “residual passing” stages of their morphisms.",

    "abstract": "In constructive set theory, an ordinal is a hereditarily transitive set. In homotopy type theory, an ordinal is a type with a transitive, wellfounded, and extensional binary relation. Which notion is more expressive? We can tackle this question if we first interpret set theory into type theory, using Peter Aczel's sets as trees interpretation (recast in homotopy type theory using higher inductive types), and then compare the notions directly in type theory. With more work, it is possible to generalise the comparison to capture all sets in Aczel's interpretation rather than only the ordinals. This leads to a natural class of ordered structures which contains the type-theoretic ordinals and realises the higher inductive interpretation of set theory.\n\n This is joint work with Tom de Jong, Nicolai Kraus, and Chuangjie Xu.",

    "abstract": "One of the most exciting ideas in categorical systems theory is being able to give a clean definition to “emergent effects”, namely failure of a lax functor to be a functor. But there is a lack of theoretical tools to do useful things after identifying this common situation. I will present work in progress towards a “theory of contexts”, talking formally about the idea that an open system’s behaviour can depend on what other systems are nearby, by isolating 1 of the 3 key theoretical ingredients of open games. This hopefully allows situations with emergent effects to be seen as an ordinary functor, although working out examples is irritatingly difficult.",

Other statements are not provable constructively, even though they are true when using classical logic (for example: \"every bounded inhabited subset of real numbers has a least upper bound\"). How can we convince ourselves of this fact, so that we do not waste time and effort looking for a constructive proof? We can construct a so-called Brouwerian counterexample by showing that the claimed statement implies a known non-constructive principle. Brouwer called such principles omniscience principles, because only an all-knowing being can hope to for example decide if P or not P holds for every proposition P. I will give an introduction to some of the more common omniscience principles such as LPO, LLPO and Markov's Principle, and try to give some intuition for when one should expect a statement to not have a constructive proof; an important skill in order to avoid heartbreak when working in a constructive setting such as type theory or the internal logic of a category.

What does it mean to say game theory and gradient-based learning look alike? How do we study the behaviour of cybernetic systems? Inspired by Myers' categorical system theory I formulated some tentative answers to these questions. Alas, they require the full breadth of spatial dimensions this universe provides. In this talk I will quickly introduce the ideas behind my version of 'categorical cybernetic system theory', including recent developments regarding the definition of a theory of cybernetic systems.

A typing rule is a server for its conclusion and a client for its premises. Every signal in a typing interaction has a sender, transmitting the signal as a syntactic object, but also a guarantor, promising that the signal is in some way meaningful. We are thus in a position to distinguish \"citizens\" (signals whose guarantor is their sender) from \"subjects\" (signals whose guarantor is their receiver). The two can and should be treated rather differently. Citizens should be free from the relitigation of their status and judged according to their semantics.

    "title": "Can we compose Dependent Lenses as Optics?",
    "abstract": "In this talk, I'll use Idris 2 to live code work in progress thoughts related to lenses and optics. I'll focus on the relatively unknown fact that, even though lenses and optics are denotationally equivalent, operationally they have a different composition rule, with a different space-time complexity. In the case of optics this composition uses up more space, but less time. While in the non-dependent case it is well understood how to take a bidirectional gadget and switch between a lens-like and an optic-like composition, in the dependent case it not. In this talk, I won't answer the question in the title, but am instead hoping to frame it in proper context. I'll do type-directed programming, and at points invoke linear types, hoping to be guided by the compiler in search of an answer.",

I will introduce a 3-dimensional syntax that has usual string diagrams and extensive form as 2 orthogonal projections. But first, we need to talk about parallel universes…\n\n This talk summarises a paper I’ve had brewing for a couple of years and want to actually write soon, that clarifies and expands on a tweet I wrote in October 2019. It is the secret thread connecting a couple of bits of my research in that time: dependent optics (joint work with half of MSP) and sheet diagrams (joint work with Antonin Delpeuch and Cole Comfort). In short: We define a bimonoidal category of dependent open games with tensor product and external choice, and then equip it with the natural 3d syntax for bimonoidal categories.",

    "abstract": "Filtration is a common technique in modal logic. The central idea is to consider a (large or even infinite) model M satisfying a property P of interest. By identifying states in a controlled way, one may (greatly) reduce the size of the M — in fact, one has an upper bound depending only on P. Filtration for basic modal logic is quite straightforward, but may be more difficult for extensions, particularly those involving fixpoint operators. PDL (propositional dynamic logic) is a much-studied such extension of modal logic, used for reasoning about properties of programs.\n\n I will introduce filtration for basic modal logic, and prove preservation of the desired properties. I will do the same for PDL, highlighting the difficulty introduced by the fixpoint operator.\n\n If there is enough time and interest, I will also discuss filtrations for monotone PDL, which is PDL interpreted on a more general class of models (namely monotone neighborhood models).",

In more complicated situations, we have to go beyond stages indexed by natural numbers to stages indexed by larger structures — ordinals, a cornerstone of modern mathematics. These are well understood classically, but less so in a constructive setting, where different equivalent classical notions split apart, with different advantages and disadvantages for each. I will show how a theory of different ordinals can be developed constructively in the setting of homotopy type theory, and how modern type-theoretic features such as higher inductive types and inductive-inductive definitions can be used to construct ordinal notation systems that truly behave like ordinals, with extensional and wellfounded order relations.\n\n Joint work with Nicolai Kraus and Chuangjie Xu.",

A weighted graph is represented by a matrix M whose shortest paths are found as F(M) = Sum_{n >=0} M^n. Weighted graphs may be joined along a common boundary via pushout and the composition problem for F asks how the values of F on a pushout may be obtained from the values of F on its components. In this talk I will show how this abstract nonsense may be turned into an actual algorithm which computes shortest paths compositionally. Optimistically, this algorithm and the relevant results may be adapted to the more general setting of the algebraic path problem.",

A relevant term uses every variable in its support at least once; a relevant substitution uses every variable in its target support in the image of at least one variable in its source support; relevant substitutions thus map terms relevant in their source support to terms relevant in their target support.\n\n The \"codeBruijn\" machinery that makes my treatment of relevant terms work is based on the semisimplicial category: its objects are variable supports and its hom-sets are binomial coefficients seen as types of bit vectors representing selections. There are deep connections between the structure exhibited by this category and the Good Old Boolean Logic of the bits in the vectors. Meanwhile, relevant substitutions themselves constitute the morphisms of a category whose objects are also variable supports. What keeps the roof up is the double category whose squares tell you what happens to the target scope of a relevant substitution when you select some particular variables from its source.",

Every such presentation induces a canonical graded monad equipped with interpretations of these operations. As part of this work, we reformulate graded monads and related concepts in terms of locally graded categories, which provide a useful setting for working with grading.\n\n This is joint work with Shin-ya Katsumata, Tarmo Uustalu and Nicolas Wu.",

On the other hand, a series of results developed in particular in the past decade have shown that Nash equilibria are, in certain senses, universal for s.a. sets, and that the Nash equilibrium correspondence contains, in a certain sense, all s.a. functions as well as some classes of correspondences. Relations to some problems concerning complexity of finding Nash equilibria will be mentioned. No prior knowledge of semi-algebraic geometry is assumed.",

    "abstract": "Are types for telling us what to program, or for telling us what we have programed? MSP dogma leans to the former, but it is worth looking at the latter too.\n\n If we take types to be explanations of programs' behaviour, then it is only natural that they can have multiple types, since programs may have multiple behaviours. Intersection types are the basic tool that allows the assignment of multiple behavioural descriptions to a single program.\n\n Traditional intersection types are idempotent: if we know that a term has some behaviour, then it is of no interest to know this twice. Inspired by linear logic, however, we can start to wonder what happens if we record how many times we will need a program to have some behaviour -- non-idempotent intersection types.\n\n When we start counting behaviours, something remarkable happens. In a result due to Daniel de Carvalho, it turns out that the size of the typing derivation is equal to the number of steps taken to evaluate the program in the Krivine Abstract Machine.\n\n I'll describe the non-idempotent intersection type system for a CBN untyped lambda-calculus, and how to prove de Carvalho's result. If here is time, I'll also discuss how non-idempotent intersection types relate to the relational semantics of Linear Logic.\n\n An Agda formalisation of de Carvalho's result is written up here: <a href='https://bentnib.org/posts/2020-08-13-non-idempotent-intersection-types.html'>https://bentnib.org/posts/2020-08-13-non-idempotent-intersection-types.html</a>",

    "abstract": "Denotational semantics specifies the meaning of a computer program by associating it with an abstract mathematical object (its <em>denotation</em>), which represents its behaviour. In the case of game semantics, a program is interpreted as a two-player game, played between the program and its environment. More precisely, types are modelled by arenas (on which the game is played), while the programs themselves are modelled by strategies played on those arenas. Game semantics originated in the 1990's to solve the full abstraction problem for PCF (i.e., λ-calculus with a fixpoint operator); but the framework is very flexible, and many variants have been proposed to describe control, state, probability, concurrency, and many other program constructs.\n\n In this talk, I will start with a (very) brief introduction to denotational semantics in general, and define the concept of full abstraction. Then, I will present the game semantics model for PCF (à la Hyland-Ong), and if time allows, show how to extend it to model mutable references. I aim to keep the presentation intuitive and informal, relying mostly on examples and pictures.",

Imagine planar circuits connecting a sequence of inputs to a sequence of outputs, built from components similarly taking a sequence of inputs to a sequence of outputs. They are categorical: you can wire the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another if they match. They are monoidal: you can place them in parallel, concatenating input and output sequences. They have an equational theory which amounts to allowing arbitrary jiggling around in the plane, just as long as you keep everything connected in the same way and treat wires and components as deformable but impassable boundaries. Can we decide this equational theory? Yes, in principle, but how might we do it in practice? What would it take to give unique normal forms for such circuits as inductively defined data? Fred, Jules and I were staring at this puzzle one evening, looking over a notebook for a clue to plant upon the page, in a pub not so many minutes away known for the central stairway up to its mezzanine. We were staring at circuits and staring at the stairway, until we began to see the stairways in the circuits. And it made us wonder!",

    "title": "Data types with negative information",
    "abstract": "Inductive data types are a foundational tool for representing data and knowledge in dependently typed programming languages. The user provides a collection of rules that determine positive evidence for membership in the type. Elimination of an inductive type corresponds to structural induction on its members.\n\n But what if our data modelling requires negative information as well as positive? For example, representing the result of a backtracking parser requires evidence that a certain parsing attempt *didn't* work. Standard formulations of inductive types do not allow negative information mixed with positive.\n\n Mixing positive and negative information has been studied in logic programming, resulting in concepts like Negation as Failure, stable models, and answer set programming. Incorporating negative information into systems of rules leads us into the realm of non-monotonic logics, where simply adding knowledge does not necessarily preserve existing conclusions.\n\n In this talk, I'll describe a way to understand data types with negative information in type theory by combining ideas from 3-valued stable models in logic programming and constructive negation (or refutation) from linear logic. The hope is that by adding negation to data types we will be able to represent some reasoning tasks more easily in dependent types.",

    "title": "Constructing disjunctive formulas in the modal mu-calculus",
    "abstract": "The modal mu-calculus is a general modal fixpoint logic that allows to reason about the ongoing, possibly infinite behaviour of a transition system. For example, the temporal logics from Sean's 101 talk a few weeks ago can be seen as fragments of the mu-calculus.\n\n In this talk I am planning to give a brief introduction to the mu-calculus and then focus on a key result about the logic: every formula is equivalent to a so-called disjunctive formula. Constructing a disjunctive formula of \"small\" size is important e.g. for satisfiability checking. I am going to sketch a construction that yields a disjunctive formula that is single-exponential in the closure size of the input formula. The construction will highlight a few subtleties that arise when thinking about the size of a mu-calculus formula.\n\n Based on joint work with Johannes Marti and Yde Venema.",

    "title": "When completeness is not enough: introduction to algebraisable logics",
    "abstract": "The relation between logic and algebra is often expressed by existence of equational completeness theorems stating that a certain logic L is complete with respect to a certain class of algebras K. Perhaps the most famous example is given by the class of Boolean algebras and classical propositional logic. However, CPC is also complete with respect to the class of Heyting algebras by a negative translation. In order to recover a univocal connection, we need to dig deeper into the theory of algebraisability [1] - an algebraisable logic admits a unique algebraic semantics.\n\n In this talk we will introduce some notions and basic results from the theory of algebraisable logics. We will further propose an extension to the theory to accommodate for logics with weaker forms of substitutions (e.g. logics of dependence and independence, various epistemic logics).\n\n This is joint work with Davide Quadrellaro.\n\n [1] W.

    "abstract": "Graph grammars and double-pushout rewriting are pretty old news at this point. But the abstract rewriting systems produced by (hyper)graph grammars actually carry an extremely rich compositional and algebraic structure, many aspects of which have remained woefully under-investigated. We will show how causality relations in non-deterministic hypergraph rewriting systems can effectively be captured by means of a strict monoidal 2-category (a “multiway system”), and how higher homotopy types may consequently be constructed by adjoining appropriate sets of additional rewriting rules, with the n → ∞ limit of the resulting n-fold category yielding an ∞-groupoid (the classifying space of which forms an (∞,1)-topos). We will discuss how this general framework has been applied pragmatically in the design of efficient automated theorem-proving and diagrammatic reasoning software, before concluding with a more speculative discussion of the potential applicability of the overall formalism to the foundations of physics (especially categorical quantum mechanics and discrete quantum gravity).\n\n This is joint with Xerxes Arsiwalla.",

We will then go on a tour of LTL, CTL, CTL*, and the modal 𝜇-calculus. Key destinations on the tour will include the respective expressive power and model-checking complexity of each, particularly in comparison to the 𝜇-calculus. <del>I will end the tour with a closer look at the model-checking problem of the 𝜇-calculus, and its relationship to parity games.</del>",

I will explain how this category is obtained from a category of ``continuous-time coalgebras'' opindexed by polynomials, and describe how this recipe also gives categories of nondeterministic systems in arbitrary (continuous) time. These new specimens are motivated by the cybernetic question of how to model systems that are continuously performing approximate Bayesian inference. I will therefore sketch why their better-known cousins weren't quite up to the job, and show that our new SMC admits Bayesian inversion. Finally, I will attempt to make contact with the MSP branch of categorical cybernetics, asking what makes the shapes of our structures seem so similar-but-different, and how we might begin to understand systems nested within systems.",

Even better, so it could help you and guide you towards the program that you want to write? So that knowing what you are doing could become a responsibility shared between human and machine, instead of being only your problem? Using dependent types, and some care, we can achieve this by encoding the precise meaning of the program in its type -- any implementation will consequently be correct *by construction*. I will give a demonstration of such dependently typed programming, based in part on a nice recent draft functional pearl by Wouter Swierstra: \"A correct-by-construction conversion to combinators\" [1].

To demonstrate the differences, I'll talk about how we can construct a type of real numbers in Agda in terms of the Cauchy completion of the metric space of rational numbers. This yields an implementation of real numbers that is reasonably efficient and that we can do proofs about. The basic construction closely follows Russell O'Connor's \"A monadic, functional implementation of real numbers\" [1]. I'll also talk about using the completion of a metric space to implement quantitative equational theories over complete separable metric spaces in Agda. I'll try to work from the assumption that the audience knows nothing about metric spaces, completion, or construction of real numbers.\n\n [1] <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605058'>https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0605058</a>",

    "abstract": "I will tell a (very simplified) story about how the adaptive immune system works through the medium of rules. Rules are compositional creatures that can be looked at from the perspective of structured cospans, algebras or double pushout graph rewriting systems. I won't belabour the abstract interpretation, rather I will concentrate on how they can be used to good effect to both explain (normal mode) immune response to a pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 and generate a model that can be simulated and reproduces some interesting heterogeneity that is observed in the world. Furthermore, compositionality means that this set of rules can be freely combined with sets of rules for transmission and diagnostic testing and will show this in action. Finally, I’ll speculate about some other kinds of models that it might be interesting to incorporate.",

    "abstract": "As a notion to represent disjoint sets of memory locations, regions serve as the basis of various techniques for e.g. memory management and pointer analysis. They are closely interrelated with effects, and have been illustrated to be useful for improving the precision of analysis. We generalize the notion of region to represent properties of values, introduce a region type system for Featherweight Java (FJ) that is parametrized with a monad-like structure, and prove a uniform soundness theorem. Its instances include some type systems studied by Martin Hofmann et al. as well as a new one that performs more precise analysis of trace-based program properties. Our region type system is separate from the FJ type system, making it simpler and also easier to move to larger fragments of Java. The uniform framework helps to avoid redundant work on the meta-theory when extending the system to cover other language features such as exception handling. This is joint work with Ulrich Schöpp.",

In the Border Patrol Project  we are interested in being able to reason about the structure & behaviour of designs as a whole, regardless of if we can inspect each module down to the individual gates.\n\n Following on from my SPLS Nov '20 I want to update everyone on my journey in capturing the physical structure of hardware design using lambda-calculi. Specifically, I will re-introduce System-V, a typed lambda calculus that is based upon the well-known hardware description and verification language SystemVerilog. I will show how a System-V design can capture physical hardware design in the Verilog style, and its type-system enforce correct wiring. I will then show how we can formally look beyond System-V itself (and hardware design by extension) by leveraging known-things from programming-language theory, and posit on where to go from here.",

They consist of a set equipped with a “mixture” operator satisfying some axioms, and are variously known as (abstract) convex sets, convex algebras, barycentric algebras, etc. Every actually-convex subset of a real vector space is a convex set, but there are less expected examples too: every join-semilattice can be seen as a convex set, and there are examples that combine aspects of both vector spaces and semilattices.\n\n I will spend a lot of time on the basic theory and examples, which is mostly due to Marshall Stone. I’ll then transition into talking about work in progress with Paolo Perrone and Sharwin Rezagholi, in which we aim to prove a version of Brouwer’s fixpoint theorem for convex sets. Specifically, we aim to construct a “topological realisation” functor F: Conv -> Top and find sufficient convex properties on X such that F(X) satisfies the fixpoint property for continuous maps. Along the way we prove a classification theorem: every convex set can be decomposed as a family of convex subsets of vector spaces “fibred over” a semilattice (slightly improving a similar unpublished result by Tobias Fritz).",

We show that such a theory is the quantitative analogue of a Conway theory and also of an iteration theory; and it reflects the metric coinduction principle.  We study the Bellman equation for a Markov decision process as an illustrative example.\n\n This is a recent joint work with Gordon Plotkin and Prakash Panangaden.",

    "title": "Internal ∞-Categories with Families",
    "abstract": "It is natural to formalise the notion of a model of type theory (especially the syntax = intended initial model) inside type theory itself. This is often done by writing the definition of a category with families (CwF) as a generalised algebraic theory. What could the success criterion from a HoTT point of view be? The typical first goal is that the initial model is an h-set or even has decidable equality. Our second goal is to make the \"standard model\" work, i.e. the universe U should be a CwF in a straightforward way (cf. Mike Shulman's 2014 question whether the n-th universe in HoTT models HoTT with n-1 universes). Unfortunately, it is hard to combine these two goals. If we include set-truncatedness explicitly in the definition of a CwF, then the \"standard model\" is not a CwF. If we don't, then the initial model is not an h-set. The root of the problem is that 1-categories are not well-behaved concepts in an untruncated setting. The natural approach are higher categories, which corresponds to \"equipping the syntax with all coherences\" instead of truncating. In this talk, I will explain one approach to this based on a type-theoretic formulation of Segal spaces, expressed in HTS/2LTT. I will discuss what works and what is still open.

While in the past we were happy to know whether two programs/algorithms/machines behave the same or not, today it is obvious that this is not enough for our purposes. We need, more and more, to be able to reason about and measure the similarity of non-identical computational behaviours. Moreover, we need to speak about randomness in computational phenomena, especially when we formalize learning or behaviours in unknown contexts. Last but not least, we need to eventually replace the classic metatheory of computation with a probabilistically-based one, where questions can be answered probabilistically within controlled confidence boundaries.\n\n I will not have the time to approach all these during the talk, but I will try to give an overview of the mathematical instruments one needs to approach such a complex challenge.",

    "abstract": "I’ll introduce event structures, a model of computation in which behaviour is captured through partial orders of causal dependency between events.  As an application I'll show their role in a theory of concurrent/distributed games and strategies, which has been useful in the semantics of computation, also for probabilistic and quantum programs.  Though originally motivated by the limitations of traditional semantics, through determinacy and value theorems, and the preservation of winning/optimal strategies under composition, a form of structural game theory is emerging.  In this talk I'll concentrate on what I see as connection points with work here at Strathclyde: as a lead in, relations with the stable domain theory of Berry and Girard; then, the view of strategies as profunctors, whence how they connect to the traditional domain theory of Scott; concluding with how distributed strategies support certain dialectica categories and lenses, and through them open games.  My hope is that these connections will be fruitful.  On the one side, distributed games can offer a rich metalanguage which extends to probabilistic and quantum computation.",

    "title": "Containers",
    "abstract": "How do we represent and reason about data types, in general? The theory of containers is one answer, which is locally quite popular in the MSP group (and beyond). A container is given by a collection of shapes, and for each shape, a collection of positions, where one is meant to plug in data. Containers can be used to analyse generic constructions on data types, without resorting to a messy induction over syntax.\n\n Each container induces a functor from Set to Set, which maps an \"element type\" X to the set of containers with data drawn from X. Furthermore, there is a natural notion of morphism of containers, with the remarkable property that it completely captures the natural transformations between the functors the containers represent: the interpretation functor from containers to the functor category from Set to Set is full and faithful. In general, the category of containers is extremely nice, eg containers are closed under almost all operations you can imagine (composition, products, coproducts, exponentials, initial algebras, final coalgebras, ...). I hope to give an introductory talk that will make the above more precise.",

The Kleisli category of this monad is of particular interest: it corresponds to \"stochastic maps\" between spaces.\n\n It turns out that one can actually often do without the monad - the Kleisli category itself carries enough structure that one can do probability theory \"internally\", rederiving the notions of determinism, independence of measures, and many others.

I'll cover the construction of categories of realizable functions, usually called the category of Assemblies, and its interesting sub-category, the category of Modest Sets or PERs.

Thus, Open Games form a symmetric monoidal category. There are many flavors of open games, ranging from small variations on how equilibria are treated, to more radical changes such as introducing probabilistic behavior. Proving from scratch that each variant still forms a monoidal category is tedious.\n\n I will present a compositional construction of the category of Open Games, which consists of three main steps. In each step, one can swap a component for a similarly-behaved one, without disturbing the rest of the structure. Thus, one can define many variants of Open Games with minimal effort. This compositional approach is based on the notion of Arrows, a concept first introduced in functional programming.\n\n This is a practise talk for ACT20 next week, and joint work with Bob, Bruno, Neil, Clemens and Fred.",

    "title": "Building Resource-Dependent EDSLs in a Dependently-Typed Language",
    "abstract": "While many people use dependent types for theorem proving some of us like to use dependent types for building, and running, safer programs.\n\n Idris' <i>Effects</i> library demonstrates how to embed resource dependent algebraic effect handlers into a dependently typed host language, providing run-time and compile-time based reasoning on type-level resources. Building upon this work, <i>Resources</i> is a framework for realising EDSLs with type systems that contain domain specific substructural properties. Differing from <i>Effects</i>, <i>Resources</i> allows a language's substructural properties to be encoded within type-level resources that are associated with language variables. Such an association allows for multiple effect instances to be reasoned about autonomically and without explicit type-level declaration. We use type-level predicates as proof that a language's substructural properties hold.\n\n Using <i>Resources</i> we have shown how to provide correctness-by-construction guarantees that substructural properties of written programs hold when working with =Files=, specifying Domain Specific =BiGraphs=, and Global Session Descriptions---=Sessions=. With this talk I want to discuss the how and why of <i>Resources</i>, and show how we can use the framework to build EDSLs with interesting type-systems.\n\n This talk is part practise talk for ECOOP 2020, part tutorial on an important idiom for practical dependently-typed programming, and part chance to highlight more how dependent-types are useful when programming in the real world.",

Somewhat independently, grading has become a topic of interest in type theory and programming language semantics, with graded structures again providing a means of more fine-grained reasoning. In this talk, I will give an overview of this idea (both its past and present) and explore two uses: (1) using graded modal types for program reasoning in the context of an experimental functional language with linear and indexed types, called Granule; (2) specialising program semantics to give correct-by-construction arguments about program analyses and transformations.

Then, I will discuss recent work by myself and Bob on adapting this method to semiring-graded calculi. The result is a pleasingly and surprisingly minor variation on the original, comprising the introduction of a linear map to mediate usage annotations.

Last time I talked about Mary, she was just a twinkle in my eye. Now, she is at least a toddler.\n\n Mary is a variant on pandoc markdown which allows code fragments to be embedded in documents and document fragments to be embedded in code. This talk will focus mainly on the programming language embedded in the system which is currently called \"Shonkier\", as it is a variant on the \"Shonky\" language to which Frank compiles. It is untyped, for the time being, but that's an opportunity.\n\n The key design choice in Shonkier is that the C-style function application notation, f(e1,..,en), is used for all sorts of contextualization, and there are many such sorts. \"Functions\" (which already generalize to effect handlers) are but one form of context. We have also added first class environments (computed by pattern matching expressions) and guarding contexts (computed by Boolean expressions). One recent tweak which pays dividends is that effect handlers can now reply to requests with effects as well as with values. We are now free to negotiate various forms of contingency in a refreshingly direct style.\n\n In short, we have abandoned the naive delights of being context-free in favour of being context-negotiable.",

Even better, dimensions can not only be used to tell scientists off when making mistakes, but also to deduce non-trivial formulas (the famous example being that of the period of a pendulum as a function of its mass and length, and the acceleration of gravity).\n\n From an MSP perspective, there is a strong similarity between physical dimensions and types in programming languages, and indeed, this connection was explored in the 1990's by various researchers. A concrete outcome is Andrew Kennedy's implementation of units of measure in Microsoft's F# language, which makes it possible to write F# programs that are dimensionally-correct by construction.\n\n However, a lot of numerical software is written manipulating not single numbers, but vectors and matrices, using the methods of linear algebra.

The interpretation translates Heyting Arithmetic (HA) into System T (intended as an axiomatization of primitive recursive functionals of finite type) and was originally developed as a tool to prove the relative consistency of HA. Translating the contraction rule poses certain problems and as a solution, Gödel requires decidability of atomic formulae. Several variants exist that lift this restriction.\n\n In this talk, I will present the categorical constructions from de Paiva's paper. We will investigate their structure and see how the different versions of the interpretation are accommodated in this setting. Finally, we will conclude that in the process we have obtained a model of Intuitionistic Linear Logic.",

The traditional way to interpret epistemic logic formulas is by using Kripke models: that is, graphs whose vertices represent the possible worlds, and whose edges indicate the agents that cannot distinguish between two worlds. I will present an alternative kind of model for epistemic logic based on chromatic simplicial complexes. Simplicial models are equivalent to Kripke models; thus, this connection uncovers the higher-dimensional geometric nature of knowledge.

    "title": "Something About Mary",
    "abstract": "Quite a few colleagues in the MSP group have experienced both the pleasure and the pain of working with my Marx system in the course of delivering our classes. (I never meant to write a virtual learning environment, but somehow, I sort of did.) I propose to re-engineer it from scratch and do a rather better job (suitable for wider deployment) deliberately, and am keen to solicit assistance in this mission, lest it be yet another engineering project distinguished by my madness and dissolution that you are, even so, obliged to put up with. Inevitably, I will struggle and rapidly fail to exclude interesting computer science from the design of the system. There will be fun.\n\n Mary will be a content management system with pages written in Markdown and stored in git repositories on the department's GitLab server. However, every such page is also a form, supporting interactive content. Pages will therefore need to embed code for processing the data in the form, certainly on the server, but preferably (unlike in Marx) on the client. So Mary will embed a programming language that we might have fun designing and implementing. I propose to base this language on Frank, an effects and handlers language that I cooked up a while back. Access to form fields can be seen as an effect: by remember the resumption for each such access, we can model what to recompute in the client when fields change, after the fashion of spreadsheets, programmed in apparently direct style.\n\n Mary will also need to maintain a database to achieve cross-session persistence of student work and staff configuration data. The Marx approach to analytics over this database amounted to \"grep\". In the meantime, however, Fred and I spent quite a while thinking about how to give an account of data models and analytics at a higher level of abstraction using carefully undermarketed ideas from dependent type theory. We should consider how to adapt these ideas to manage our own data.\n\n Let's get excited and make things!\n\n (Comrades who are not Strathclyders but who are interested in effects, types, or just having better tools to survive this business we call higher education, should very much feel invited to engage. I will happily export this project.)",

This works because the calculi are presented in a bidirectional style which, by design, causes every redex to carry some \"potatoes\", which hopefully contain enough inductive carbohydrate to keep you going for the whole of the computation to be done.\n\n Naturally, it would be lovely if we could prove that the interpreter's output is genuinely a reduct of its input, and that well typed input yields normal form output (i.e., that an honest type gives the potatoes required to do the whole computation). How is it done? Potato-powered logical relations, of course! I'll give a crash course on cooking programs and proofs with potatoes.",

A concurrent program can be viewed as a topological space equipped with a notion of direction, modeling the passage of time. Thus, in such a space, the existence of a path from A to B does not guarantee the existence of a path from B to A. A path in a directed space corresponds to an execution of the program; and two such executions are equivalent when the corresponding paths are homotopic, that is, when they can be deformed continuously into one another. This idea motivated the development of directed algebraic topology, the analogue of algebraic topology for directed spaces.",

The talk that you will see is going to be very unpolished; this is stuff that I have been working on for the past while, and the material will not be fully formed yet. The things I say may not end up matching with reality. So with that minor caveat, let us continue.\n\nA Hopf algebra is a monoid, a comonoid, and an extra endomorphism such that various commutation rules are obeyed, and Hopf monads are a strange generalisation of Hopf algebras in the direction of monads. I have previously talked about when a Hopf algebra is a Hopf-Frobenius algebra, and my goal now is to generalise this to the case of Hopf Monads. However, to keep things interesting, I am doing this in a weird way.\n\nLet T be a Hopf monad in monoidal category C. T is isomorphic to a Hopf algebra if there exists a natural transformation e: T -> 1 that respects the Hopf monad structure. There are many examples of Hopf monads which are not isomorphic to any Hopf algebras, so this morphism does not exist in C in general. However, what happens if I formally add in this morphism, creating a new category C_e? In this category, T would presumably be isomorphic to a Hopf algebra, and this begs the question: what can T in C_e tell us about T in C? By looking at the natural functor C -> C_e,  can I use this to transfer my theorem about Hopf algebras to Hopf monads? I certainly believe so, but let's find out together!",

The key codebruijn type constructor is \"pair a thing with a thinning from some support\", and it turns any old sort of thing into something which uniformly admits further thinning just by postcomposition, without affecting either the thing or its support.\n\nStuff-which-uniformly-admits-thinning is stuff with structure, so there is a forgetful functor back to plain old Stuff. The Free functor which adds uniform thinning, is its left adjoint. The codebruijn type constructor is the monad (Free;Stuff). The corresponding comonad, (Stuff;Free), is rather more familiar to semanticists as the abstraction over <em>larger</em> scopes found in Kripke models.\n\nI've always been a bit shaky on adjunctions, presheaves and what have you, so this talk will not assume categorical confidence, but rather seek to build intuition, guided by a concrete example grounded in the practicalities of manipulating syntax.",

    "title": "A Purely Functional Array Language and its Optimising GPU Compiler",
    "abstract": "Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to efficient parallel code. It is a statically typed, data-parallel, and purely functional array language, and comes with a optimising ahead-of-time compiler that generates GPU code via OpenCL and CUDA. Futhark is not designed for graphics programming, but instead uses the compute power of the GPU to accelerate data-parallel array computations (\"GPGPU\").\n\nThis talk presents the design of the Futhark language, as well as outlines several of the key compiler optimisations that have enabled performance comparable to hand-written GPU code. Through the use of a functional source language, we obtain strong invariants that simplify and empower the application of traditional compiler optimisation techniques. In particular, I will discuss (i) aggressively restructuring transformations such as fusion, (ii) loop interchange and distribution to extract flat parallel kernels from nested parallel source programs, (iii) multi-versioned code generation that exploits as much parallelism as necessary and efficiently sequentialises the rest, and (iv) data layout transformations to ensure coalesced memory access on GPUs.",

    "abstract": "Bigraphs are a mathematical model (hypergraph) for representing the spatial and communication structures of networked entities [fn:1]. Bigraph Reactive Systems (BRS) build upon bigraphs by incorporating temporal changes to a model as specified with reaction rules. There is a wealth of theory (category) that supports reasoning about bigraphs, and an emergent tool (BigraphER [fn:2]) for their modelling.\n\nBigraphs have an elegant algebraic structure that is general purpose and simply typed. However, it is common to place restrictions on the shape of a bigraph by a <i>system of sorts</i> that are applied as side-conditions. The details, and application, of these sorts are presented as an aside from the bigraph definition itself. This makes transformation of Bigraph models harder to enforce during manipulation as part of a BRS. We must provide runtime checks to provide relevant guarantees over model correctness.\n\nIn this talk, I want to introduce you to the interesting world of Bigraph specification, and my current and ongoing work on developing a dependent type-system to embed a system-of-sorts directly into the algebraic definition of bigraphs. This allows one to provide correct-by-construction guarantees that a given model is correct w.r.t. a provided system-of-sorts.\n\n[fn:1] Robin Milner. 2009.

    "abstract": "Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRS) are a universal model of computation introduced by Robin Milner for the representation of interacting systems that evolve in both time and space. Bigraphs have been shown forming a category called symmetric partial monoidal category and their dynamic theory is defined in terms of rewriting and transition. A limitation of bigraphs is that the underlying model of location is a forest, which means there is no straightforward representation of locations that can overlap or intersect. In this talk, I will present bigraphs with sharing, an extension of bigraphs which solves this problem by defining the model of location as a directed acyclic graph, thus allowing a natural representation of overlapping or intersecting locations. I will give a complete presentation of the extended theory, including a categorical semantics, algebraic properties, a normal form and several essential procedures for computation.",

System behavior then only depends on those states that are \"reachable\" from the initial state. This has both consequences for the theory (e.g. by allowing to prove non-definability results in modal logic) and practice (by making seemingly large systems more manageable) of such systems.\n\nCoalgebras provide a general model for transition systems. In this introductory talk I will discuss how to define the reachable part of a coalgebra via the notion of T-base for an endofunctor T from [1]. We will first discuss this notion and then provide a sufficient categorical condition for the existence of the T-base. We will then show how to characterise the reachable part of a coalgebra as least fixpoint of a monotone operator.\n\nThis is based on joint work with Simone Barlocco and Jurriaan Rot.\n\n========================\n[1] Alwin Blok.

Here, we focus on the role of MDPs as models in optimal planning, where the reward structure is central. Our main contributions are: (i) a coinductive explanation of policy improvement using a new proof principle, based on Banach's Fixpoint Theorem, that we call contraction coinduction, and (ii) showing that the long-term value function of a policy can be obtained via a generalized notion of corecursive algebra, which takes boundedness into account.\n\nThis is joint work with Frank Feys (Delft) and Larry Moss (Indiana).",

We'd like to treat arrays as functions from indices to values with some domain restrictions.  It is desirable that these domain restrictions are specified in a compact form, and are equipped with closed algebraic operations like intersection, union, etc.  We are going to consider a few typical models like hyperrectangulars, grids and polyhedrons.\n\nWhen typing array operations, ideally we'd like to find a balance between tracking all the shapes of arrays and allowing for generic array operations.  This proves to be tricky, for reasons we'll explain.\n\nWe will propose, tentatively, an analysis of MDAs in terms of container functors.  The aim is to supply concepts helpful when thinking about MDAs, e.g. when designing notations for coding with arrays.  Some intriguing gadgetry shows up.",

This often reveals some information about the original system (e.g. classical logic is equiconsistent with constructive logic). G&ouml;del's Dialectica interpretation (named after the journal it was published in) translates Heyting arithmetic (the constructive theory of the natural numbers, including induction) into System T (the quantifier-free theory of the simply typed lambda calculus with natural numbers) &mdash; quantifier complexity is traded for higher type complexity. Combining this translation with (a refined) double negation translation, one can extract System T programs from a proof of a forall-exists statement, even if this proof is using non-constructive priciples such as Markov's Principle, Excluded Middle, or the Quantifier-Free Axiom of Choice. I've always found the Dialectica translation mystifying, so I'll try to explain the intuition behind it.",

    "abstract": "Higher inductive types (HITs) in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) allow the definition of datatypes which have constructors for equalities over the defined type. HITs generalise quotient types and allow to define types which are not sets in the sense of HoTT (i.e. do not satisfy uniqueness of equality proofs) such as spheres, suspensions and the torus. However, there are also interesting uses of HITs to define sets, such as the Cauchy reals, the partiality monad, and the internal, total syntax of type theory.  In each of these examples we define several types that depend on each other mutually, i.e. they are inductive-inductive definitions. We call those HITs quotient inductive-inductive types (QIITs).\n\nAlthough there has been recent progress on the general theory of HITs, there isn't yet a theoretical foundation of the combination of equality constructors and induction-induction, despite having many interesting applications. In the present paper we present a first step towards a semantic definition of QIITs. In particular, we give an initial-algebra semantics and show that this is equivalent to the section induction principle, which justifies the intuitively expected elimination rules.",

While researchers have developed various techniques for verifying such properties for standard, deterministic programs, relational properties for probabilistic programs have been more challenging. In this talk, I will survey recent developments targeting a range of probabilistic relational properties, with motivations from privacy, cryptography, machine learning. The key idea is to meld relational program logics with an idea from probability theory, called a probabilistic coupling. The logics allow a highly compositional and surprisingly general style of analysis, supporting clean proofs for a broad array of probabilistic relational properties.",

These protocols described not only the structural properties of the physical interfaces but also the behaviour of the emanating signals. However, there is a disconnect between the design of SoC architectures, their formal description, and the verification of their implementation in known hardware description languages.\n\nWithin the Border Patrol project we are investigating how to capture and reason about the structural and behavioural properties of SoC architectures using state-of-the-art advances in programming language research. Namely, we are investigating using dependent types and session types for the description of hardware communication.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss my work in designing a linked family of languages that captures and reasons about the topological structure of a System-on-a-Chip. These languages provide correct-by-construction guarantees over the interaction protocols themselves; the adherence of a component that connects using said protocols; and the validity of the specified connections. These guarantees are provided through abuse of indexed monads to reason about resource usage; and general (ab)use of dependent types as presented in Idris.\n\nI will not cover all aspects of the languages but will concentrate my talk detailing the underlying theories that facilitate the correct-by-construction guarantees.",

Hence finding such a transformation is at least as hard as solving parity games, which is commonly believed to be quite hard.\n\nWe employ an automata-theoretic approach that relates the different measures for the size of a formula to different constraints on the transition structure of an automaton corresponding to the formula.\n\nThis is a very technical talk but there will be many pictures!",

Its well known principal vice is its inconsistency: you can write a looping program inhabiting any type (thus 'proving' any proposition). I'll be talking about the design principles for constructing dependent type systems which are bidirectional &mdash; clearly split into a type  checking part and a type synthesis part. By following these principles, it gets easier to establish good safety properties of these systems. In particular, I'll sketch how to keep type safety (\"well typed programs don't go wrong\") separate from normalization (\"all computations terminate\"). Martin-L&oumlf's 1971, reformulated bidirectionally, makes a good example, because it's small and type-safe, but not normalizing.",

    "title": "Syntax and semantics of Quantitative Type Theory",
    "abstract": "At last year's WadlerFest celebration, Conor presented a dependent type theory where variables are tagged with information about how they are used. Variable usage tagging has been developed in the non dependent setting, starting with Girard's Linear Logic, and culminating with recent work in contextual effects, coeffects, and quantitative type theories. The subtlety with dependent types lies in how to account for the difference between usage in types and terms. Conor's system handles this by treating usage in types as a \"zero\" usage, so that it doesn't affect the usage in terms. This is a departure from previous \"linear\" type theories that maintains a strict separation between usage controlled information, which types cannot depend on, and unrestricted information, which types can depend on.\n\nConor presented a syntax and typing rules for the system, as well as an erasure property that exploits the difference between \"not used\" and \"used\", but doesn't do anything with the finer usage information available. I'll present a collection of models for the system that fully exploit the usage information. This will give interpretations of type theory in resource constrained computational models, Geometry of Interaction models, and imperative models. To maintain order, I will gather all these notions of model under a new concept of \"Quantitative Category with Families\", a generalisation of the standard \"Category with Families\" class of models of dependent types.",

I will present a model of dynamical networks and evolutionary game theory that explains these phenomena as consequence of imitation and endogenous conflicts between \"cooperators\" and \"cheaters\". Cooperators promote well-connected prosperous (but fragile)  networks and cheaters cause the network to fragment and lose its prosperity. Once the network is fragmented it can be reconstructed by a new invasion of cooperators, leading to recurrent cycles of formation and fragmentation observed, for instance, in bacterial communities and socio-economic networks. In the last part of the talk, I will briefly introduce my current works on the role of individual decision-making in cooperative communities and the possibility of synthetic biology to address these ideas in microbial communities.\n\nReferences\n\nM.

    "title": "Differential Operators",
    "abstract": "A traditional source of complaint from CS undergraduates (especially in the USA, but in other places, too) is that they are made to learn too much standard issue mathematics with little apparent relevance to computation. Differential calculus (with its usual presentational focus on physical systems) is often picked upon as the archetype. What we see in action is the fragile male ego: they are not so quick to complain about the unimportance of things they do not find difficult. All of which makes more delicious the irony that differential operators have a key role to play in understanding discrete structures, such as automata, datatypes, execution stacks, and plenty more.\n\nThe basic idea is as follows: to put your finger over any single K in the pair of words <div class='centered'>BREKEKEKEX KOAXKOAX</div> you must choose either to put your finger over a single K in BREKEKEKEX and pair with KOAXKOAX intact, or to leave BREKEKEKEX intact and cover a K in KOAXKOAX. You have just followed Leibniz's rule for differentiating a product (with respect to K), and computed a one-hole context for a K in a data structure.\n\nNewton, of course, would point out that such derivatives arise as the limit of a divided difference, a concept worthy of study in more generality. I would point out that divided differences are often definable, even in situtations when neither division nor difference makes much apparent sense. Notably, Brzozowski's derivative for regular languages is a divided difference (even though it is not Leibniz's derivative).\n\nI'll work mainly with containers (which look a lot like power series) but make sure there are plenty of concrete examples. In practice, it becomes rather useful to compute derivatives by pattern matching on types, which is especially funny as symbolic differentiation is the first example in the literature of computing anything by pattern matching at all.",

    "title": "On the expressive power of user-defined effects: effect handlers, monadic reflection, delimited control without answer-type-modification",
    "abstract": "We compare the expressive power of three programming abstractions for user-defined computational effects: Bauer and Pretnar's effect handlers, Filinski's monadic reflection, and delimited control. This comparison allows a precise discussion about the relative merits of each programming abstraction.\n\nWe present three calculi, one per abstraction, extending Levy's call-by-push-value. These comprise syntax, operational semantics, a natural type-and-effect system, and, for handlers and reflection, a set-theoretic denotational semantics. We establish their basic meta-theoretic properties: adequacy, soundness, and strong normalisation. Using Felleisen's notion of a macro translation, we show that these abstractions can macro-express each other, and show which translations preserve typeability.  We use the adequate finitary set-theoretic denotational semantics for the monadic calculus to show that effect handlers cannot be macro-expressed while preserving typeability either by monadic reflection or by delimited control. We supplement our development with a mechanised Abella formalisation.\n\nJoint work with Yannick Forster, Sam Lindley, and Matija Pretnar.",

    "abstract": "We explore the design and implementation of Frank, a strict functional programming language with a bidirectional effect type system designed from the ground up around a novel variant of Plotkin and Pretnar's effect handler abstraction.\n\nEffect handlers provide an abstraction for modular effectful programming: a handler acts as an interpreter for a collection of commands whose interfaces are statically tracked by the type system. However, Frank eliminates the need for an additional effect handling construct by generalising the basic mechanism of functional abstraction itself. A function is simply the special case of a Frank <i>operator</i> that interprets no commands.\n\nMoreover, Frank's operators can be <i>multihandlers</i> which simultaneously interpret commands from several sources at once, without disturbing the direct style of functional programming with values.\n\nEffect typing in Frank employs a novel form of effect polymorphism which avoid mentioning effect variables in source code. This is achieved by propagating an <i>ambient ability</i> inwards, rather than accumulating unions of potential effects outwards.\n\nI'll give a tour of Frank through a selection of concrete examples.\n\n(Joint work with Conor McBride and Craig McLaughlin) ",

This made it possible to avoid code duplication as well as prove these semantics' properties generically.\n\nPutting these two ideas together, we give an abstract description of syntaxes with binding making both their recursive and scoping structure explicit. The fundamental lemma associated to these syntaxes can be instantiated to provide the user with proofs that its language is stable under renaming and substitution as well as provide a way to easily define various evaluators.",

    "abstract": "A <dfn>filter</dfn> P is a consistent deductively closed set of predicates. A filter is <dfn>prime</dfn> when\n<div class='centered'>(&phi; &or; &psi;) &isin; P &rArr; (&phi; &isin; P &or; &psi; &isin; P)</div>In words: if phi-or-psi is in P then phi is in P or psi is in P. Primeness gives soundness for disjunction.\n\nUsing this it is not hard to construct a semantics to propositional logic in which a predicate &phi; \"means\" the set of prime filters containing it.  This is a standard \"trick\" for building semantics and is an extremely useful proof-method.\n\nI have developed a semantics for predicate logic and also for the lambda-calculus based on similar notions of filter, but in a <i>nominal</i> context &mdash; meaning that filters are developed using Fraenkel-Mostowski (FM) set theory instead of Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory.  What matters here is that FM sets have additional name structure over ZF sets, and this additional structure can be exploited to give semantics to the extra structure that predicates have over propositions, and in particular the additional name structure lets us write down primeness conditions for soundness for universal quantification.\n\nThe resulting semantics is rich and interesting.  In a sentence: nominal techniques help us to extend the notion of Stone representation and duality from propositional logic to full first-order logic (also with equality, if we wish, and also to other logics and calculi with variables and quantifiers).\n\nI will give a detailed description of the filter-style conditions involved, and discuss some of what I think they tell us about predicates and quantification in logic and computation.

For each of these properties we provide a corresponding syntactic fragment, in the sense that a mu-calculus formula \\phi has the given property iff it is equivalent to a formula \\phi' in the corresponding fragment. Since this formula \\phi' will always be effectively obtainable from \\phi, as a corollary, for each of the properties under discussion, we prove that it is decidable in elementary time whether a given mu-calculus formula has the property or not.\n\nThe properties that we study have in common that they all concern the dependency of the truth of the formula at stake, on a single proposition letter p. In each case the semantic condition on \\phi will be that \\phi, if true at a certain state in a certain model, will remain true if we restrict the set of states where p holds, to a special subset of the state space. Important examples include the properties of complete additivity and (Scott) continuity, where the special subsets are the singletons and the finite sets, respectively.\n\nOur proofs for these characterisation results will be automata-theoretic in nature; we will see that the effectively defined maps on formulas are in fact induced by rather simple transformations on modal automata.",

We apply compositional reasoning to sophisticated games where agents must reason about how their actions affect future games and how those future games effect the utility they receive. This forces us into a second innovation &mdash; we augment the usual lexicon of games with a dual notion to utility because, in order for games to accept utility, this utility must be generated by other games. Our third innovation is to represent our games as string diagrams so as to give a clear visual interface to manipulate them. Our fourth, and final, innovation is a categorical formalisation of these intuitive diagrams which ensures our reasoning about them is fully rigorous.\n\nThe talk will be general so as appeal to as wide an audience as possible.

    "title": "On the rule algebraic reformulation of graph rewriting",
    "abstract": "Motivated by the desire to understand the combinatorics of graph rewriting systems, it proved necessary to invent a formulation of graph rewriting itself that is not based on category theoretic structures as in the traditional framework, but on the concept of diagrammatic combinatorial Hopf algebras and reductions thereof. In this talk, I will present how the classical example of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra of creation and annihilation of indistinguishable particles, which can alternatively be interpreted as the algebra of discrete graph rewriting, gave the initial clues for this novel framework. In hindsight, to pass from the special case of discrete graph rewriting to the case of general graph rewriting required every aspect of the framework of diagrammatic combinatorial Hopf algebras as a guideline for the construction, yet none of the traditional category theoretic ideas, whence one might indeed consider this reformulation as an independent formulation of graph rewriting.\n\nThe new framework results in a number of surprising results even directly from the formulation itself: besides the two main variants of graph rewriting known in the literature (DPO and SPO rewriting), there exist two more natural variants in the new framework. For all four variants, graph rewriting rules are encoded in so-called rule diagrams, with their composition captured in the form of diagrammatic compositions followed by one of four variants of reduction operations. Besides the general structure theory of the resulting algebras aka the rule algebras, one of the most important results to date of this framework in view of applications is the possibility to formulate stochastic graph rewriting systems in terms of the canonical representations of the rule algebras. Notably, this is closely analogous to the formulation of chemical reaction systems in terms of the canonical representation of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra aka the bosonic Fock space. The presentation will not assume any prior knowledge of the audience on the particular mathematics required for this construction, and will be given on the whiteboard. The work presented is the result of a collaboration with Vincent Danos and Ilias Garnier (ENS Paris/LFCS University of Edinburgh), and (in an earlier phase) with Tobias Heindel (University of Copenhagen).",

    "title": "Comprehensive Parametric Polymorphism",
    "abstract": "In this talk, we explore the fundamental category-theoretic structure needed to model relational parametricity (i.e., the fact that polymorphic programs preserve all relations) for the polymorphic lambda calculus (a.k.a. System F). Taken separately, the notions of categorical model of impredicative polymorphism and relational parametricity are well-known (lambda2-fibrations and reflexive graph categories, respectively). Perhaps surprisingly, simply combining these two structures results in a notion that only enjoys the expected properties in case the underlying category is well-pointed. This rules out many categories of interest (e.g. functor categories) in the semantics of programming languages.\n\nTo circumvent this restriction, we modify the definition of fibrational model of impredicative polymorphism by adding one further ingredient to the structure: comprehension in the sense of Lawvere. Our main result is that such comprehensive models, once further endowed with reflexive-graph-category structure, enjoy the expected consequences of parametricity. This is proved using a type-theoretic presentation of the category-theoretic structure, within which the desired consequences of parametricity are derived. Working in this type theory requires new techniques, since equality relations are not available, so that standard arguments that exploit equality need to be reworked.\n\nThis is joint work with Neil Ghani and Alex Simpson, and a dry run for a talk in Cambridge the week after.",

    "abstract": "String diagrams give a powerful graphical syntax for morphisms in symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs). They find many applications in computer science and are becoming increasingly relevant in other fields such as physics and control theory.\n\nAn important role in many such approaches is played by equational theories of diagrams, which can be oriented and used as rewrite systems. In this talk, I'll lay the foundations for this form of rewriting by interpreting diagrams combinatorially as typed hypergraphs and establish the precise correspondence between diagram rewriting modulo the laws of SMCs on the one hand and double pushout (DPO) rewriting of hypergraphs, subject to a soundness condition called convexity, on the other. This result rests on a more general characterisation theorem in which we show that typed hypergraph DPO rewriting amounts to diagram rewriting modulo the laws of SMCs with a chosen special Frobenius structure.\n\nIf there's time, I'll also discuss some of the results we have in developing the rewrite theory of hypergraphs for SMCs, namely termination proofs via graph metrics and strongly convex critical pair analysis.",

    "abstract": "In 1963, Bill Lawvere characterised universal algebra in category theoretic terms. His formulation being category theoretic was not its central contribution: more fundamental was its presentation independence. Three years later, monads were proposed as another category theoretic formulation of universal algebra. Overall, the former are technically better but the relationship is particularly fruitful and the latter are more prominent, cf Betamax vs VHS. So we study Lawvere theories carefully in the setting of universal algebra and in relation to monads.",

    "title": "Excuse My Extrusion",
    "abstract": "I have recently begun to learn about the Cubical Type Theory of Coquand et al., as an effective computational basis for Voevodsky's Univalent Foundations, inspired by a model of type theory in cubical sets. It is in some ways compelling in its simplicity, but in other ways intimidating in its complexity. In order to get to grips with it, I have begun to develop my own much less subtle variation on the theme. If I am lucky, I shall get away with it. If I am unlucky, I shall have learned more about why Cubical Type Theory has to be as subtle as it is.\n\nMy design separates Coquand's all-powerful \"compose\" operator into smaller pieces, dedicated to more specific tasks, such as transitivity of paths. Each type path Q : S = T, induces a notion of value path s {Q} t, where either s : S, or s is •, \"blob\", and similarly, t : T or t = •. A \"blob\" at one end indicates that the value at that end of the path is not mandated by the type. This liberalisation in the formation of \"equality\" types allows us to specify the key computational use of paths between types, extrusion:\n\nif Q : S = T and s : S, then s ⌢• Q : s {Q} •\n\nThat is, whenever we have a value s at one end of a type path Q : S = T, we can extrude that value across the type path, getting a value path which is s at the S end, but whose value at the T end is not specified in advance of explaining how to compute it. Extrusion gives us a notion of coercion-by-equality which is coherent by construction. It is defined by recursion on the structure of type paths. Univalence can be added to the system by allowing the formation of types interpolating two equivalent types, with extrusion demanding the existence of the corresponding interpolant values, computed on demand by means of the equivalence.\n\nSo far, there are disconcerting grounds for optimism, but the whole of the picture has not yet emerged: I may just have pushed the essential complexity into one corner, or the whole thing may be holed below the waterline. But if it does turn out to be nonsense, it will be nonsense for an interesting reason.",

This makes them a useful tool for understanding several different computational phenomena.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show how coherence spaces naturally model session types, via Wadler's interpretation of Classical Linear Logic as a session-typed pi-calculus, and how that interpretation extends to an interpretation of a dependently typed version of session types.",

    "title": "Proof-theoretic semantics for dynamic logics",
    "abstract": "Research in the proof theory of dynamic logics has recently gained momentum. However, features which are essential to these logics prevent standard proof-theoretic methodologies to apply straightforwardly. In this talk, I will discuss the main properties proof systems should enjoy in order to serve as suitable environments for an inferential theory of meaning (proof-theoretic semantics). Then, I'll identify the main challenges to the inferential semantics research agenda posed by the very features of dynamic logics which make them so appealing and useful to applications. Finally, I'll illustrate a methodology generating multi-type display calculi, which has been successful on interesting case studies (dynamic epistemic logic, propositional dynamic logic, monotone modal logic).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "title": "Coinduction, Equilibrium and Rationality of Escalation",
    "abstract": "Escalation is the behavior of players who play forever in the same game.  Such a situation is a typical field for application of coinduction which is the tool conceived for reasoning in infinite mathematical structures. In particular, we use coinduction to study formally the game called <i>dollar auction</i>, which is considered as the paradigm of escalation.  Unlike what is admitted since 1971, we show that, provided one assumes that the other agent will always stop, bidding is rational, because it results in a subgame perfect equilibrium.  We show that this is not the only rational strategy profile (the only subgame perfect equilibrium).  Indeed if an agent stops and will stop at every step, whereas the other agent keeps bidding, we claim that he is rational as well because this corresponds to another subgame perfect equilibrium.  In the infinite dollar auction game the behavior in which both agents stop at each step is not a Nash equilibrium, hence is not a subgame perfect equilibrium, hence is not rational.  Fortunately, the notion of rationality based on coinduction fits with common sense and experience.  Finally the possibility of a rational escalation in an arbitrary game can be expressed as a predicate on games and the rationality of escalation in the dollar auction game can be proved as a theorem which we have verified in the proof assistant COQ.  In this talk we will recall the principles of infinite extensive games and use them to introduce coinduction and equilibria (Nash equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium).  We will show how one can prove that the two strategy profiles presented above are equilibria and how this leads to a \"rational\" escalation in the dollar auction.  We will show that escalation may even happen in much simpler game named 0,1-game.",

    "title": "Interacting Frobenius Algebras Are Hopf",
    "abstract": "Commutative Frobenius algebras play an important role in both Topological Quantum Field Theory and Categorical Quantum Mechanics;  in the first case they correspond to 2D TQFTs, while in the second they are non-degenerate observables.  I will consider the case of \"special\" Frobenius algebras, and their associated group of phases.  This gives rise to a free construction from the category of abelian groups to the PROP generated by this Frobenius algebra.  Of course a theory with only one observable is not very interesting.  I will consider how two such PROPs should be combined, and show that if the two algebras (i) jointly form a bialgebra and (ii) their units are \"mutually real\"; then they jointly form a Hopf algebra.  This gives a \"free\" model of a pair of strongly complementary observables.  I will also consider which unitary maps must exist in such models.\n\nSlides are <a href='http://personal.strath.ac.uk/ross.duncan/talks/2015/vienna.pdf'>here</a> if you want a preview.",

Its careful distinction of environment and model values as well as its variation on a structure typical of a Kripke semantics make it capable of expressing renaming and substitution but also various forms of Normalisation by Evaluation as well as, perhaps more surprisingly, monadic computations such as a printing function.\n\nWe then demonstrate that expressing these algorithms in a common framework yields immediate benefits: we can deploy some logical relations generically over these instances and obtain for instance the fusion lemmas for renaming, substitution and normalisation by evaluation as simple corollaries of the appropriate fundamental lemma. All of this work has been formalised in Agda.",

    "abstract": "The Polymorphic Blame Calculus (PBC) of Ahmed et al. (2011) combines polymorphism, as in System F, with type dynamic and runtime casts, as in the Blame Calculus. The PBC is carefully designed to ensure relational parametricity, that is, to ensure that type abstractions do not reveal their abstracted types. The operational semantics of PBC uses runtime sealing and syntactic barriers to enforce parametricity. However, it is an open question as to whether these mechanisms actually guarantee parametricity for the PBC. Furthermore, there is some question regarding what parametricity means in the context of the PBC, as we have examples that are morally parametric but not technically so. This talk will review the design of the PBC with respect to ensuring parametricity and hopefully start a discussion regarding what parametricity should mean for the PBC.",

    "title": "Two-dimensional proof-relevant parametricity",
    "abstract": "Relational parametricity is a fundamental concept within theoretical computer science and the foundations of programming languages, introduced by John Reynolds. His fundamental insight was that types can be interpreted not just as functors on the category of sets, but also as equality preserving functors on the category of relations. This gives rise to a model where polymorphic functions are uniform in a suitable sense; this can be used to establish e.g. representation independence, equivalences between programs, or deriving useful theorems about programs from their type alone.\n\n The relations Reynolds considered were proof-irrelevant, which from a type theoretic perspective is a little limited. As a result, one might like to extend his work to deal with proof-relevant, i.e. set-valued relations. However naive attempts to do this fail: the fundamental property of equality preservation cannot be established. Our insight is that just as one uses parametricity to restrict definable elements of a type, one can use parametricity of proofs to ensure equality preservation. The idea of parametricity for proofs can be formalised using the idea of 2-dimensional logical relations. Interestingly, these 2-dimensional relations have clear higher dimensional analogues where (n+1)-relations are fibered over a n-cube of n-relations. Thus the story of proof relevant logical relations quickly expands into one of higher dimensional structures similar to the cubical sets which arises in Homotopy Type Theory. Of course, there are also connections to Bernardy and Moulin's work on internal parametricity.",

    "title": "The probability of the Alabama paradox",
    "abstract": "There exists various possible methods to distribute seats proportionally between states (or parties) in a parliament. Hamilton's method (also known as the method of largest reminder) was abandoned in the USA because of some drawbacks, in particular the possibility of the Alabama paradox, but it is still in use in many other countries.\n\nIn recent work (joint with Svante Janson) we give, under certain assumptions, a closed formula for the probability that the Alabama paradox occurs given the vector p_1,...,p_m of relative sizes of the states.\n\nFrom the theorem we deduce a number of consequences. For example it is shown that the expected number of states that will suffer from the Alabama paradox is asymptotically bounded above by 1/e. For random (uniformly distributed) relative sizes p_1,...,p_m the expected number of states to suffer from the Alabama paradox converges to slightly more than a third of this, or approximately 0.335/e=0.123, as m -> infinity.\n\n I will assume no prior knowledge of electoral mathematics, but begin by giving a brief background to various methods suggested and used for the distribution of seats proportionally in a parliament (it's all in the rounding).",

There was some technical stuff, too, about representing a recursive definition as a construction in the free monad whose effect is calling out to an oracle for recursive calls: that tells you what it is to be recursive without prejudicing how to run it. I'm trying to write this up double-quick as a paper for the miraculously rubbery MPC deadline, with more explicit attention to the monad morphisms involved. So I'd be grateful if you would slap down the shtick and make me more morphic. The punchline is that the Bove-Capretta domain predicate construction is a (relative) monad morphism from the free monad with a recursion oracle to the (relative) monad of Dybjer-Setzer Induction-Recursion codes. But it's worth looking at other monad morphisms (especially to the Delay monad) along the way.",

    "abstract": "It would be a great shame if dependently-typed programming (DTP) restricted us to only writing very clever programs that were a priori structurally recursive and hence obviously terminating. Put another way, it is a lot to ask of the programmer to provide the program and its termination proof in one go, programmers should also be supported in working step-by-step. I will show a technique that lowers the barrier of entry, from showing termination to only showing productivity up front, and then later providing the opportunity to show termination (convergence). I will show an example of a normaliser for STLC represented in Agda as a potentially non-terminating but nonetheless productive corecursive function targeting the coinductive delay monad.\n\n(Joint work with  Andreas Abel)",

    "abstract": "I've managed to prove a theorem that I've been chasing for a while. The trouble, of course, was <em>stating</em> it. I'll revisit the motivation for extending type systems with an analysis of not just <em>what</em> things are but <em>where</em>, <em>when</em>, <em>whose</em>, etc. The idea is that typed constructions occur in one of a preordered set of worlds, with scoping restricted so that information flows only \"upwards\" from one world to another. Worlds might correspond to \"at run time\" and \"during typechecking\", or to computation in distinct cores, or in different stages, etc. What does the dependent function space mean in this setting? For a long time, I thought that each world had its own universal quantifier, for abstracting over stuff from that world. Failure to question this presumption is what led to failure to state a theorem I could prove. By separating quantifiers from worlds, I have fixed the problem. I'll show how to prove the key fact: if I can build something in one world and then move it to another, then it will also be a valid construction once it has arrived at its destination.",

By extending them to the lambda calculus with monadic types, we can gain understanding of the properties on functional programming languages with computational effects. Among various constructions of logical relations for monads, I will talk about a categorical TT-lifting, which is a semantic analogue of Lindley and Stark's leapfrog method.\n\nAfter reviewing some fundamental properties of the categorical TT-lifting, we apply it to the problem of relating two monadic semantics of a call-by-value functional programming language with computational effects. This kind of problem has been considered in various forms: for example, the relationship between monadic style and continuation passing style representations of call-by-value programs was studied around '90s. We give a set of sufficient conditions to solve the problem of relating two monadic semantics affirmatively. These conditions are applicable to a wide range of such problems.",

In this talk, I'll discuss syntax, type, <em>and</em> analysis directed semantics (analysis-directed semantics for short!), for analyses other than types. An analysis-directed semantics maps from terms coupled with derivations of a static program analysis into some semantic domain. For example, the simply-typed lambda calculus with an effect system maps to the category generated by a strong parametric effect monad (due to Katsumata) and a bounded-linear logic-like analysis (described as a coeffect systems) maps to a category generated by various structures related to monoidal comonads. I'll describe a general technique for building analysis-directed semantics where semantic objects and analysis objects have the same structure and are coupled by lax homomorphisms between them. This aids proving semantic properties: the proof tree of an equality for two program analyses implies the rules needed to prove equality of the programs' denotations.",

It now seems like it is  possible to give a variation of this encoding for which the  induction principle is derivable after all. The trick is to use  identity types to cut down the transformations of type  (Pi X : Set) .

The current practice is to find the appropriate stack for a given task using intractable brute force and heuristics. By restricting attention to algebraic stack combinations, we provide a linear-time algorithm for generating all the appropriate monad stacks, or decide no such stacks exist. Our approach is based on Hyland, Plotkin, and Power's algebraic analysis of monad transformers, who propose a graph-theoretical solution to this problem. We extend their analysis with a straightforward connection to the modular decomposition of a graph and to cographs, a.k.a. series-parallel graphs.\n\nWe present an accessible and self-contained account of this monad-stack generation problem, and, more generally, of the decomposition of a combined algebraic theory into sums and tensors, and its algorithmic solution. We provide a web-tool implementing this algorithm intended for semantic investigations of effect combinations and for monad stack generation.",

We'll cover the good news: the inhabited types are the tautologies of minimal classical logic, and Godel's Double Negation translation from classical to intuitionistic logic turns into the CPS translation.\n\nAnd the bad news: control operators don't play well with other types. Add natural numbers (or some other inductive type), and you get inconsistency. Add Sigma-types, and you get degeneracy (any two objects of the same type are definitionally equal).
