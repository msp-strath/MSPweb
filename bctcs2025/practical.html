      <h3>Colloquium dinner</h3>
      <p>We have booked at table Tuesday evening 7pm at <a href="https://nonnasaid.com/">Nonna Said</a>, a nearby Napoli-style pizza place with lots of vegetarian and vegan options.

      <h3>Accommodation</h3>
      <p>There are many hotels in and around the city centre, as well as some hostels. The very nearest hotels to the university are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/scotland/strathclyde/glasgow/glasgow-city-centre-george-square.html">Premier Inn George Square</a> (100m)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-gb/hotels/glaox-moxy-glasgow-merchant-city/">Moxy Merchant City</a> (250m)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/glaar-ac-hotel-glasgow/">AC Hotel by Mariott Glasgow</a> (300m)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.thezhotels.com/hotels/glasgow">Z Hotel Glasgow</a> (300m)</li>
        </ul>

      <p>The Premier Inns at <a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/scotland/strathclyde/glasgow/glasgow-city-centre-st-enoch-square.html">St Enoch Square</a> and particularly <a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/scotland/strathclyde/glasgow/glasgow-city-centre-south.html">Glasgow City Centre South</a> (just south of the River Clyde), are a bit further away (~25 min walk for the latter), but are normally cheaper than their George Square counterpart.</p>

      <p>For those willing to share a dorm, the <a href="https://revolverhotel.co.uk/">Revolver Hotel</a> (private rooms also available) may be worth a look.</p>
