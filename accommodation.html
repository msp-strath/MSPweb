                <h2>Accommodation and travel information</h2>
<p>The MSP group is located in the <strong>University of
Strathclyde</strong>, on the 13th floor of the <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/D1AMG5wtLsYL783g7"><strong>Livingstone
Tower</strong></a>. The entrance is on the north side of the building,
on Richmond Street. The University of Strathclyde is in central Glasgow,
near all of Glasgow Queen Street train station, Glasgow Central train
station, and Buchanan Bus Station.</p>
<p>The following map shows several key locations (click on the link

<h3>Travelling to Glasgow</h3>
<p><strong>By train.</strong> See <a
href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">National Rail</a> for trains
within the UK. Note that if travelling together with someone, it might
be cheaper to get a <a
href="https://www.twotogether-railcard.co.uk/">Two Together railcard</a>
(or a <a href="https://www.16-25railcard.co.uk/">16–25 railcard</a> if
you are a (PhD) student). Both Glasgow Central and Glasgow Queen Street
Station are within walking distance of the University of Strathclyde
(see map above). Trains from London take 4.5 hours. Another option is to
travel overnight on the <a href="https://www.sleeper.scot/">Caledonian
Sleeper</a> from London, which arrives in Glasgow just after 7am. If you
are arriving from the continent, you can take the <a
href="http://www.eurostar.com/">Eurostar</a> to London, and then take
another train to Glasgow (see <a href="http://www.seat61.com/">The Man
in Seat 61</a> for more information).</p>
<p><strong>By plane.</strong> The closest airports are <a
href="http://www.glasgowairport.com/">Glasgow International Airport</a>
(30 minutes bus connection (<a
href="https://www.firstgroup.com/greater-glasgow/routes-and-maps/glasgow-airport-express">bus
500</a>) to George Square), <a
href="http://www.edinburghairport.com/">Edinburgh Airport</a> (1 hour
bus connection (<a
href="http://www.citylink.co.uk/citylinkair.php">Citylink Air</a>) to
Buchanan Bus Station) and <a
href="http://www.glasgowprestwick.com/">Glasgow Prestwick Airport</a>
(40-50 minutes <a
href="http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/PRA/Glasgow/today/1200/dep">train
connection</a> to Glasgow Central).</p>
<p><strong>By car.</strong> Parking in Glasgow city centre — where the
University of Strathclyde is located — is expensive and hard to find.
The cheapest and possibly easiest option is to <a
href="https://www.spt.co.uk/travel-with-spt/other-travel-options/park-and-ride/">park
and ride</a>.</p>
<h3>Getting around</h3>
<p>The city centre is quite compact, so walking is not a bad idea.
Otherwise your options are suburban trains, the subway, bikes for hire,
buses or taxis. You will need a separate ticket for each mode of
transport.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can buy <a href="https://www.scotrail.co.uk/">train</a> tickets
in the ScotRail mobile phone app, using ticket machines at most stations
(if you can't, you can buy them on the train, or before leaving the
destination station). Bafflingly, it's sometimes cheaper to buy a return
ticket, and even if not, the difference in price is going to be minimal,
so you might as well always buy the return. After 9am, you can use a
cheaper "off-peak" ticket.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.spt.co.uk/subway/">Subway</a> is easy to
use, but does not reach all parts of the city. A single ticket costs
£1.80, and a return £3.40, so you might as well get two singles unless
you are sure you are going to return on the subway again.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nextbike.co.uk/en/glasgow/">Nextbike</a>
operates a bike sharing scheme with stations all across the city. You
sign up and then rent the bikes using an app on your phone, which will
give you a code to unlock them. Without a yearly subscription, the price
is £2/20 minutes; this might be enough time to get you to many places in
Glasgow, and is the cheapest non-walking option.</li>
<li>Most buses in Glasgow are operated by <a
href="https://www.firstgroup.com/greater-glasgow">First</a>. You can pay
with a contactless debit/credit card (tap on when you enter and tap off
when you leave the bus), or with exact cash change. It is suprisingly
hard to find out what the cost of a ticket is going to be before you
enter the bus. It is probably easiest to use <a
href="https://goo.gl/maps/uXvhQXNGAbY8Btka8">Google maps</a> to figure
out which bus to get, and when.</li>
<li>Taxis are reasonably priced in Glasgow. Decent companies include <a
href="http://www.hampdencars.co.uk/">Hampden cars</a> (phone number <a
href="tel:01413325050">0141 332 5050</a>) and <a
href="http://www.networkprivatehire.com/">Network Private Hire</a>
(phone number <a href="tel:01415571110">0141 557 1110</a>). They both
have apps for booking a ride, but there is also Uber in the city.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hotels</h3>
<p><strong>Budget.</strong> A cheap nearby option is <a
href="https://revolverhotel.co.uk/">Revolver Hostel</a>. It is also
worth considering using <a
href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/Glasgow">Airbnb</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Medium.</strong> A convenient place to stay is the <a
href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/scotland/strathclyde/glasgow/glasgow-city-centre-george-square.html">Glasgow
City Centre Premier Inn</a>, literally across the road from Livingstone
Tower. (There are several Premier Inn locations in central Glasgow; the
closest one is "George Square", but several others are also within
walking distance.) Other decent hotels nearby include the <a
href="https://www.thezhotels.com/glasgow">Z Hotel</a> in North Frederick
Street and the <a href="https://www.brunswickhotel.co.uk/">Brunswick
Hotel</a> in Brunswick Street.</p>
<p><strong>Fancy.</strong> The <a
href="https://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/glaox-moxy-glasgow-merchant-city/">Moxy
Hotel</a> and <a
href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/glaar-ac-hotel-glasgow/overview/">AC
Hotel</a> are also right next to the University of Strathclyde campus.
If you want even fancier, there is the five-star <a
href="https://www.kimptonblythswoodsquare.com/">Blythswood Square
Hotel</a> still within walking distance.</p>
<h3>Renting a flat</h3>
<p>Here are a few tips for MSP newcomers looking to rent a flat in
Glasgow.</p>
<p>Generally, it can be a bit hard to find a place to live in Glasgow,
especially for popular areas. Book many viewings, and try to be quick
when you find a flat that you like. Viewings are often fully booked one
or two weeks in advance, so you might want to start searching before you
arrive in Glasgow. Most websites give you the option to receive alerts
by e-mail when new ads come up — that is usually a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Areas.</strong> A good rule of thumb is to not look north of
the motorway, east of Alexandra Park, west of Whiteinch or south of
King's Park. The following areas are popular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>West End</em> (Hyndland, Partick, Hillhead, Woodside): Cafes,
pubs, cute shops. Kelvingrove Park, the Botanic Gardens the Kelvin
walkway are nice green areas. Expensive. Only train, subway or cycle
distance to work.</p></li>
<li><p><em>South Side</em> (around Queen's Park, King's Park, Shawlands,
Mount Florida): Also lots of cafes and pubs and green spaces (Queen's
Park, Pollok Park) around. Not as expensive as the West End. Still only
train or cycle distance to work. Some care required, as some streets are
nicer than others.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Merchant City</em>: In the city centre. Again expensive, but
really close to work! Closest green space is Glasgow Green and the
walkway along the river Clyde.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dennistoun</em>: A mix of pretentious shops, nice cafes and
down-to-earth not-so-nice places. Walking distance to work. Glasgow
Green and Alexandra Park are the closest parks, but the north-east edge
of the city is also reachable from here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Websites.</strong> Most flats are advertised on <a
href="https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent/Glasgow.html">Rightmove</a>
with a large intersection with <a
href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/">Zoopla</a>. It might also be worth
looking at <a
href="https://www.gumtree.com/property-to-rent">Gumtree</a> for private
landlords not using an estate agent, or <a
href="https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/?search_id=1323208246&amp;">SpareRoom</a>
for flatshares.</p>
<h3>See and do</h3>
<p><em>Murals:</em> there are murals scattered all over Glasgow that are
well worth seeing. The city council has put together a <a
href="https://peoplemakeglasgow.com/things-to-do/city-centre-mural-trail">mural
trail</a> (<a
href="https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=19649&amp;p=0">PDF
with map</a>) for finding them.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.glasgowcathedral.org.uk/">Glasgow
Cathedral</a>:</em> an 800 year old church, with beautiful stained glass
windows, less than 10 mins walk away from the venue. Right next door is
<a
href="https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/venues/st-mungo-museum-of-religious-life-and-art">St.
Mungo's museum of religious art and life</a> and <a
href="https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/venues/provands-lordship">Provand's
Lordship</a>, the oldest house in Glasgow (the cathedral is not a house,
but a building).</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.glasgownecropolis.org/">The
Necropolis</a>:</em> a large cemetery on a hill overlooking the East End
of the city. Impressive views, impressive tombstones.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.tennentstours.com/">Tennent's
Brewery</a>:</em> Tennant's is the most popular beer in Scotland, and
its all produced in Glasgow. You can go on a tour, which of course
finishes with a tasting session. For a more hipster experience, the <a
href="https://www.drygate.com/">Drygate Brewery</a> next door
(part-owned by Tennant's) makes a nice selection of craft beers, and
also puts on brewery tours.</p>
<p><em>Glasgow Green:</em> this is Glasgow's oldest public outdoor
space, and the larger park closest the city centre. It contains the <a
href="https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/venues/peoples-palace">People's
Palace</a>, a kind of socialist museum, and the <a
href="https://www.westbeer.com/templeton/brewery-tour/">West
Brewery</a>, which is a German-style microbrewery. The river Clyde
borders Glasgow Green, and following the riverbank makes for a nice <a
href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/glasgow/clyde-walkway.shtml">run
or walk</a>.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/?articleid=16592">Pollok
Park</a>:</em> probably the easiest way to see some <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;as_q=highland+cattle">Highland
Cattle</a> from Glasgow. Get the train from Central to Pollokshaws
West.</p>
<p><strong>Museums</strong>. All museums below are free, except for the
House for an Art Lover.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a
href="https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/venues/gallery-of-modern-art-goma">GoMA</a>:</em>
gallery of Modern Art, in the city centre.</li>
<li><em><a
href="https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/venues/kelvingrove-art-gallery-and-museum">Kelvingrove
museum</a>:</em> the top art museum in the UK according to TripAdvisor.
Also has some history and natural history, and is set in a nice park.
Take the subway to Kelvinhall (or Kelvinbridge, and walk through the
park).</li>
<li><em><a
href="https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/venues/riverside-museum">Riverside
museum</a>:</em> an award-winning transport museum in an award-winning
building. More interesting than it sounds. Take the train or subway to
Partick.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://womenslibrary.org.uk/">Glasgow Women's
Library</a>:</em> a library, but also a museum about women's history,
culture and achievements. It was shortlisted for the Art Fund UK museum
of the year 2018. Take the train to Bridgeton.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/">The
Hunterian</a>:</em> the official museum of the University of Glasgow,
containing scientific instruments and collections, including a
two-headed sheep preserved in alcohol. Take the subway to Hillhead.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.houseforanartlover.co.uk/">House for an Art
Lover</a>:</em> showcasing the architecture and design of Charles Rennie
Mackintosh. Take the subway to Ibrox.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Whisky distilleries</strong>. The following distilleries are
more or less in Glasgow, and all offer tours.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.auchentoshan.com/">Auchentoshan</a>:</em>
the "traditional" Glasgow distillery. Take the train from Queen St to
Kilpatrick.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.theclydeside.com/">The Clydeside
Distillery</a>:</em> a brand new distillery on the river Clyde. As such,
they won't have produced any whiskey of their own for another ten years,
but they still offer tours with a tasting of other whiskies at the end.
Take the train to Exhibition Centre.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.glengoyne.com/">Glengoyne</a>:</em>
situated on the <a
href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/west-highland-way.shtml">West
Highland Way</a>, this feels more like a proper highland distillery.
Take the number 10 bus towards Balfron from Buchanon Bus station.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, if all you want to do is to <em>drink</em> whisky, then
pubs such as <a href="http://thepotstill.co.uk/">The Pot Still</a> or <a
href="https://www.bonaccordpub.com/">Bon Accord</a>, or shops such as
the <a href="http://www.thegoodspiritsco.com/">Good Spirits co</a> will
sort you out.</p>
<p><strong>Hiking</strong>. The closest mountains to Glasgow are the <a
href="https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/parks-and-greenspaces/kilpatrick-hills/">Kilpatrick
Hills</a>, the <a href="http://www.thecampsies.co.uk/">Campsie Fells</a>
and <a href="https://clydemuirshiel.co.uk/">Clyde Muirshiel Regional
Park</a>, all easily accessible by public transport. Not much further
afield are areas with proper Munros such as the Arrochar Alps along the
West Highland train line, or the mountains on the Isle of Arran. The <a
href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/">Walkhighlands</a> website has
many excellent route suggestions.</p>
