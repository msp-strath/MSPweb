<h2>MSP101</h2>

<p>MSP101 is an ongoing series of informal talks given on Wednesday
mornings by visiting academics or members of the MSP group. They are
usually announced on the
<a href="https://lists.cis.strath.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/msp-interest">
msp-interest</a> mailing-list.</p>

<h2>Upcoming talks</h2>

<dt>2014-04-02: Towards cubical type theory (<a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~txa/">T. Altenkirch<a/>)</dt>

<dt>2014-04-07, noon: Nominal sets (<a href="http://www.gabbay.org.uk/">J. Gabbay<a/>)</dt>

  <dt>2014-03-19: The selection monad transformer (G. Allais)</dt>
  <dd>
  Guillaume presented parts of Hedges' paper <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~julesh/papers/monad_transformers.pdf">Monad
    transformers for backtracking search</a> (accepted
    to <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/msfp2014/">MSFP
    2014</a>). The paper extends Escardo and Oliva's work on the
    selection and continuation monads to the corresponding monad
    transformers, with applications to backtracking search and game
    theory.

  <dt>2014-03-05, 3pm: Lagrange Inversion (S. Hannah)</dt>
  <dd>
    Stuart spoke about Lagrange inversion, a species-theoretic attempt to discuss the existence of solutions to equations defining species.
  </dd>

<dl>
  <dt>2014-02-28, 2pm: Species (N. Ghani)</dt>
  <dd>
    Neil spoke about how adding structured quotients to containers
    gives rise to a larger class of data types.

  <dt>2014-02-19: Synthetic Differential Geometry (T. Revell)</dt>
  <dd>
    Tim gave a brief introduction to Synthetic Differential
    Geometry. This is an attempt to treat smooth spaces categorically
    so we can extend the categorical methods used in the discrete
    world of computer science to the continuous work of physics.

  <dt>2014-02-12: Worlds (C. McBride)</dt>
  <dd>
    Conor talked about worlds (aka phases, aka times, ...): why one
    might bother, and how we might go about equipping type theory with
    a generic notion of permitted information flow.
  </dd>

<dl>
  <dt>2014-02-05: Operads (M. Gould)</dt>
  <dd>
    Miles Gould has kindly agreed to come through and tell us about
    Operads, thus revisiting the topic of his PhD and the city in
    which he did it.
  </dd>

  <dt>2014-01-22: Overview of (extensions of) inductive-recursive definitions (L. Malatesta)</dt>
  <dd>
  </dd>

  <dt>2014-01-08: On the recently found inconsistency of the
  univalence axiom in current Agda and Coq (C. McBride)</dt>
  <dd>
  </dd>

  <dt>2013-12-18: Quantum Mechanics (R. Duncan)</dt>
  <dd>
  </dd>

  <dt>2013-11-20: Classical Type Theories (R. Adams)</dt>
  <dd>
    In 1987, Felleisen showed how to add control operators (for things like
    exceptions and unconditional jumps) to the untyped lambda-calculus.  In
    1990, Griffin idly wondered what would happen if one did the same in a
    typed lambda calculus.  The answer came out: the inhabited types become
    the theorems of classical logic.<br />

    I will present the lambda mu-calculus, one of the cleanest attempts to
    add control operators to a type theory.  We'll cover the good news: the
    inhabited types are the tautologies of minimal classical logic, and Godel's
    Double Negation translation from classical to intuitionistic logic turns
    into the CPS translation.<br />

    And the bad news: control operators don't play well with other types. Add
    natural numbers (or some other inductive type), and you get inconsistency.
    Add Sigma-types, and you get degeneracy (any two objects of the same type
    are definitionally equal).  It gets worse: add plus-types, and you break
    Subject Reduction.

  <dt>2013-11-13: Continuation Passing Style (G. Allais)</dt>
  <dd>
    I chose to go through (parts of) Hatcliff and Danvy's paper
    <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=178053">
    "A Generic Account of Continuation-Passing Styles"</a> (POPL 94)
    which gives a nice factorization of various CPS transforms in
    terms of:
    <ul>
      <li>embeddings from STLC to Moggi's computational meta-language
          (either call-by-value, call-by-name, or whatever you can come
          up with)</li>
      <li>followed by a generic CPS transform transporting terms from ML
          back to STLC</li>
    </ul>

   Here is <a href="http://gallais.org/code/GenericCPS/definitions.html">an Agda
   file</a> containing what we had the time to see.
