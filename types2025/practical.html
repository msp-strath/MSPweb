    <section id="handout">
      <p>We have prepared a <a href="handout-TYPES2025.pdf">small handout</a> with information about the social events and some food and drink recommendations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="venue">
      <h3>Venue</h3>
      <p>TYPES 2025 will take place at the <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/maps/">University of Strathclyde campus</a> in central Glasgow. Talks will take place in room <strong>TL325</strong> in the <em>Learning and Teaching Building</em> (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/bReUXWTAfPWAdSSf6">49 Richmond Street</a>) with coffee and lunches taking place next door in room TL328. There will be signs directing you from the entrance of the building.</p>

      <p>If you would appreciate access to a quiet room during the days, or have any other requirements, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:CIS_types2025@groups.strath.ac.uk">the organisers</a> for help.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="schedule">
      <h3>Schedule</h3>
      <p>A <a href="programme.html">programme</a> is now available. The conference will run
      from 9am to 6.15pm each day, including on the first and last days.
      Tuesday afternoon is co-located with <a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/women-epn-2025/">Women in EuroProofNet</a>, and we are planning an excursion to <a href="https://www.lochlomond-trossachs.org/things-to-see/lochs-in-the-national-park/loch-lomond/">Loch Lomond</a> for Wednesday afternoon, as well as a welcome reception Monday evening and a conference dinner Thursday evening.</p>

    <section id="accommodation">
      <h3>Accommodation</h3>
      <p>There are many hotels in and around the city centre, as well as some hostels. Some good hotels very close to the university are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/scotland/strathclyde/glasgow/glasgow-city-centre-george-square.html">Premier Inn George Square</a> (across the street)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-gb/hotels/glaox-moxy-glasgow-merchant-city/">Moxy Merchant City</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/glaar-ac-hotel-glasgow/">AC Hotel by Mariott Glasgow</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.thezhotels.com/hotels/glasgow">Z Hotel Glasgow</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.thesocialhub.co/glasgow/">The Social Hub</a></li>
        </ul>

      <p>The Premier Inns at <a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/scotland/strathclyde/glasgow/glasgow-city-centre-st-enoch-square.html">St Enoch Square</a> and particularly <a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/scotland/strathclyde/glasgow/glasgow-city-centre-south.html">Glasgow City Centre South</a> (just south of the River Clyde), are a bit further away (~25 min walk for the latter), but are normally cheaper than their George Square counterpart. <a href="https://www.booking.com/city/gb/glasgow.html">Booking.com</a> have many other options.</p>

      <p>For those willing to share a dorm, the <a href="https://revolverhotel.co.uk/">Revolver Hotel</a> (private rooms also available) may be worth a look.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="travel">
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p><strong>By train:</strong> The University of Strathclyde is located short walks away from both Glasgow Queen Street train station (five minutes) and Glasgow Central train station (10 minutes). See <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">National Rail</a> for train times and connections. Trains from London take 4.5 hours. Another option is to travel overnight on the <a href="https://www.sleeper.scot/">Caledonian Sleeper</a> from London, which arrives in Glasgow 7.30am (so plenty of time to get a shower in the train station and a nice breakfast before the conference starts!). If you are arriving from the continent, you can take the <a href="http://www.eurostar.com/">Eurostar</a> to London, and then take another train to Glasgow (see <a href="https://www.seat61.com/">The Man in Seat 61</a> for more information).</p>

      <p><strong>By plane:</strong> The closest airports are <a href="http://www.glasgowairport.com/">Glasgow International Airport</a> (30 minutes bus connection (<a href="http://www.firstgroup.com/greater-glasgow/routes-and-maps/glasgow-airport-express">bus 500</a>) to George Square) and <a href="http://www.edinburghairport.com/">Edinburgh Airport</a> (1 hour bus connection (<a href="https://www.citylink.co.uk/timetables-service-updates/glasgow-to-edinburgh-airport/">Citylink Air</a>) to Buchanan Bus Station).</p>

      <p><strong>Getting around Glasgow:</strong> The city centre is quite compact, so walking is not a bad idea. Otherwise your options are suburban trains, the subway, bikes for hire, buses or taxis. You will need a separate ticket for each mode of transport.</p>

<ul>
<li>Suburban trains are reliable and can be used to get to different neighbourhoods of Glasgow. You can buy <a href="https://www.scotrail.co.uk/">train tickets</a> using ticket machines at most stations, or in the ScotRail app (if you can't, you can buy them on the train from the conductor, or before leaving the destination station). The difference in price between a return and a single ticket is minimal, so you might as well always buy the return. After 9am, you can use a cheaper "off-peak" ticket.</li>

<li>The <a href="http://www.spt.co.uk/subway/">Subway</a> is easy to use, but does not reach all parts of the city. The cost of two single tickets is almost the same as the cost of a return ticket, so you might as well get two singles unless you are sure you are going to return on the subway again.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.nextbike.co.uk/en/glasgow/">NextBike</a> operates a bike sharing scheme with stations all across the city. You sign up and then rent the bikes using an app on your phone. Without a subscription, the price is £2/20 minutes; this is borderline enough time to get you to most places in Glasgow.</li>

<li>Most buses in Glasgow are operated by <a href="https://www.firstgroup.com/greater-glasgow">First</a>. You can buy tickets using a contactless credit/debit card, an app, or using exact change. It is probably easiest to use <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/82rHUKxP8VudFTbN6">Google maps</a> to figure out which bus to get, and when.</li>

<li>Taxis are reasonably priced in Glasgow. Decent companies include <a href="https://glasgocabs.co.uk/">GlasGO Cabs</a> (phone number <a href="tel:01413325050">0141 332 5050</a>) and <a href="https://www.glasgowtaxis.co.uk/">Glasgow Taxis</a> (phone number <a href="tel:01414297070">0141 557 1110</a>). They both have apps for booking a ride, but there is also Uber in the city.</li>

    <section id="internet">
      <h3>Internet access</h3>
      <p>Eduroam Internet access is available at the conference venue; if not already configured, you can <a href="https://cat.eduroam.org/">download a configuration tool for your device here</a>.

      <h3>Other practical information</h3>

      <p><strong>Money:</strong> The currency in use is Great British Pound (GBP, symbol £). Credit cards are widely accepted. Tipping is not required, but in restaurants, a tip of around 10% is customary (this is sometimes added automatically to the bill for larger groups).</p>

      <p><strong>Time zone:</strong> During TYPES 2025, Glasgow will be in the <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/bst">British Summer Time (BST)</a> time zone (UTC+1).</p>

      <p><strong>Electricity:</strong> The standard voltage in Scotland is 240V AC, 50Hz. Plugs have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets:_British_and_related_types">3 square pins</a>, and adapters are widely available in shops.</p>

      <p><strong>Visas:</strong> Check if you require a UK visa or an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa">UK Government website</a>. Note that EU citizens will need to apply for an ETA, and that you need to do this at the latest a few days before travelling. If you need to apply for a visa, we are happy to supply a support letter for you after you have registered for the conference. Please contact <a href="mailto:CIS_types2025@groups.strath.ac.uk">CIS_types2025@groups.strath.ac.uk</a> with your name (as it appears in your passport) and your physical address if you require such a letter.</p>

      <p><strong>Things to see and do:</strong> <a href="https://www.visitglasgow.com/">Visit Glasgow</a> has much information about places worth visiting in Glasgow. Personal favourites include the Necropolis, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, and the highland cattle in Pollok Country Park. Top tip: a lot of Glasgow's amazing architecture is above street level, so don't forget to look up!</p>

      <p><strong>Running:</strong> If you would like to go for a run before or after the conference starts, there are nice running routes along the river Clyde following the <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/glasgow/glasgow-cambuslang.shtml">Clyde Walkway</a>, and along the <a href="https://static.visitscotland.com/pdf/scottish-canal-walking-guide.pdf">Port Dundas branch</a> of the Forth and Clyde Canal (and potentially beyond, e.g. following the <a href="https://www.glasgowwithkids.co.uk/the-kelvin-walkway/">Kelvin Walkway</a>).</p>
