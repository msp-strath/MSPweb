    <p><a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Brotherston/">James Brotherston</a> visiting and giving a talk in the Departmental seminar at 3pm in room LT14.15 about <em>Parametric completeness for separation theories (via hybrid logic)</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, we consider the logical gap between the following two concepts:</p>
    <p>(1) provability in a propositional axiomatisation of separation logic, which is usually given by the bunched logic BBI; and</p>
    <p>(2) validity in an intended class of models of separation logic, as commonly considered in its program verification applications. Such intended classes are usually specified by a collection of algebraic axioms describing specific model properties, which we call a separation theory.</p>
    <p>Here, we show first that several typical properties of separation theories are in fact not definable in BBI. Then, we show that these properties become definable in a natural hybrid extension of BBI, obtained by adding a theory of naming to BBI in the same way that hybrid logic extends normal modal logic. Finally, we show how to build an axiomatic proof system for our hybrid logic in such a way that adding any axiom of a certain form yields a sound and complete proof system with respect to the models satisfying those axioms. In particular, this yields sound and complete proof systems for any separation theory from our considered class (which, to the best of our knowledge, includes all those appearing in the literature).</p>
    <p>This is joint work with <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jvillar1/">Jules Villard</a>, now at Imperial.</p>

    <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/da/">David Aspinall</a> visiting and giving a talk in the Departmental seminar about <em>Managing Proofs Hierarchically</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Abstract:</strong> For the past several years, we have
      been studying the notion of hiproofs as a foundation for proof objects
      with hierarchical structure.  The idea is that a theorem proving tool
      produces an internal representation that can be inspected, navigated
      and manipulated as a hiproof.  I'll give a review of the syntactic and
      denotational formulations of hiproof, and the proof and manipulation
      languages we have designed on top.  I'll describe upcoming work which
      will build on this, including the new ProofPeer project on
      collaborative theorem proving.

    <a id="lectureship"><strong>Lectureship in the Mathematically Structured Programming Group</strong></a>

    <p>
      Applications are invited for lectureship within the MSP group at
      the University of Strathclyde The applicant's motivation must
      centre on a desire to discover beautiful mathematics of lasting
      value.  The applicant should also have an innate sense of the
      wonder of learning allied with the capacity for self-motivation
      and a track record of academic achievement.

    <p>
      The Mathematically Structured Programming Group's vision is to
      use mathematics to understand the nature of computation, and to
      then turn that understanding into practical advances within
      programming languages research. This reflects the symbiotic
      relationship between mathematics, programming, and the design of
      programming languages --- we believe that any attempt to sever
      this connection will diminish each component. In order to
      achieve these research goals, we mainly use ideas from category
      theory, type theory, and functional programming. The group
      consists of a number of internationally leading researchers
      including Professor Neil Ghani, Dr Patricia Johann, Dr Conor
      McBride, Dr Peter Hancock, Dr Robert Atkey, and our PhD
      students.

    <p>
      While the lectureship is formally in the area of Program
      Verification, this is to be interpreted broadly. Very
      broadly. Anyone interested should in the first instance contact
      Professor Neil Ghani, whose email address is "neil.ghani at
      strath.ac.uk" to register interest.  Details of the position can
      be found
      at <a href="http://www.mis.strath.ac.uk/Personnel/open/712012.pdf">http://www.mis.strath.ac.uk/Personnel/open/712012.pdf</a>.

    <p>
      The closing date for applications is Thursday July 26.

    "<a id='phd-07mar2012'></a><strong>PhD Position: Higher Dimensional Categories and Types</strong><p>Applications are invited for PhD study under the supervision of Prof Neil Ghani on any topic relating to higher dimensional category theory and/or higher dimensional type theory. The position is fully funded for EU students (apologies to non EU-citizens for this ridiculous piece of non-meritocracy) and will last for 3 years.The applicant's motivation must centre on a desire for beautiful mathematics of lasting value. The applicant should also have an innate sense of the wonder of learning allied to the capacity to work hard and achieve their goals.  </p><p>The Mathematically Structured Programming Group's vision is to use mathematics to understand the nature of computation, and to then turn that understanding into the next generation of programming languages. This reflects the symbiotic relationship between mathematics, programming, and the design of programming languages — any attempt to sever this connection will diminish each component. In order to achieve these research goals we mainly use ideas from category theory, type theory and functional programming. Besides Professor Neil Ghani, the group consists of a number of internationally leading researchers including Dr Patricia Johann, Dr Conor McBride, Dr Peter Hancock, Dr Robert Atkey as well as a number of PhD students.  </p><p>Anyone interested should in the first instance contact Professor Neil Ghani whose email address is &quot;ng at cis.strath.ac.uk&quot; and outline their academic background. Applications will be considered on a first come, first served basis.</p>"

     <a id='6monthpostdoc'></a><strong>6 Month Postdoc Position</strong> <p> Mathematically Structured Programming Group<br/> University of Strathclyde<br/> Scotland<br/> <p> We have the potential to apply for funds for a 6 month post doctoral position. The idea is that the successful candidate would spend those 6 months writing a full scale grant to fund themselves for the next 3 years.  <p> The postdoctoral position would be within the Mathematically Structured Programing group at the University of Strathclyde whose research focusses on category theory, type theory and functional programming. Current staff include Neil Ghani, Patricia Johann, Conor McBride, Peter Hancock, Robert Atkey and 6 PhD students.  <p> The candidate we are looking for should be highly self motivated and appreciate that without beauty, we are lost.  <p> Unfortunately, the deadline is extremely short and so any interested candidates should contact me immediately. I can then tell you more about what we would need to do.  <p> For more information, please contact <p> Professor Neil Ghani<br/> <a href='mailto:ng@cis.strath.ac.uk'>ng@cis.strath.ac.uk</a><br/> <a href='http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~ng/'>http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~ng/</a><br/> <a href='http://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/'>http://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/</a><br/>

    "<a id='panangaden-20110804'></a><a href='http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/'>Prakash Panangaden</a> talk. 2pm.<p><strong>Title:</strong> The Duality of State and Observation</p><p><em>Abstract:</em> In this talk we consider the problem of representing and reasoning about systems, especially probabilistic systems, with hidden state.  We consider transition systems where the state is not completely visible to an outside observer.  Instead, there are observables that partly identify the state.  We show that one can interchange the notions of state and observation and obtain what we call a dual system.  The double dual gives a minimal representation of the behaviour of the original system.  We extend this to nondeterministic systems and to probabilistic transition systems and finally to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).  In the case of finite automata restricted to one observable, we obtain Brzozowski's algorithm for minimizing finite-state language acceptors.  This is joint work with colleagues from McGill: Doina Precup and Joelle Pineau and my former student Chris Hunt.</p>"

    "<a id='scott-20110517'></a><a href='http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~phil/'>Phil Scott</a> talk.<p><strong>Title:</strong> Traced categories: algebraic structure of feedback and partial feedback in networks<p><em>Abstract:</em> In the late '80s/early '90s an algebraic structure dealing with cyclic operations emerged from various fields, including flowchart schemes, dataflow networks with feedback, action calculi, proof theory, as well as algebraic topology and knot theory. This structure is now known as a &quot;traced monoidal category&quot;, after the influential paper of Joyal, Street and Verity, who studied such categories in pure mathematics, but with an eye to applications in many fields. The concept also occurs as a basic structure in network algebra. Since then, these categories have been studied, with variations, in many areas of mathematics, logic and theoretical computer science, Recently, there has been a trend to consider partial traces and trace ideals; indeed it appears that such algebraic structures may be relevant to several areas, including biology and physics, or indeed to any field where cyclic networks are used. We give an introduction to the subject, along with some recent advances."

      <strong>Title:</strong> Voevodsky's Univalence Axiom

    <p>
      <em>Abstract:</em> Vladimir Voevodsky has recently introduced a
      semantics for constructive type theory in which types are
      interpreted as simplicial sets. This semantics validates not
      only the usual rules for identity types but also an additional
      rule, called the Univalence Axiom. The aim of the talk is to
      explain the statement of the Univalence Axiom and outline
      Voevodsky's proof that it implies a form of function
      extensionality.
